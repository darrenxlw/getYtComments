1,ok...,YouTube
2,"One of the most underrated YouTubers out there, keep the good work up man ?",YouTube
3,Buys a phone with a giant notch.....  Gets bothered by a line at the bottom.... ?,YouTube
4,Another great video . Think I will be sticking with my S8 PLUS.,YouTube
5,"On the X, You can view the battery percentage when swiping down to reveal Command Center. No need to swipe down all the way.  iOS 11 has been very disappointing. My 7 Plus was very stable with the first few versions of iOS 10, with great battery life. iOS 11 got me terrible battery life and many stability issues. After updating to 11.1 the battery life was fixed, but it’s still a VERY buggy OS. YouTube app won’t open GBoard keyboard. It’s ridiculous considering both apps are by Google.",YouTube
6,It's time for people to return iPhone x to Apple Store,YouTube
7,IOS is janky as well. It will drop frames and stutter. Apple is no longer the king of software..far from it. It won't matter to ignorant people though,YouTube
8,My iPhone X is perfect I guess I just I’m just blessed,YouTube
9,Galaxy Note 8 FTW!!!,YouTube
10,Just bought Note 8,YouTube
11,Hahahaha so much for that $ 1.000 phone If a company does have that “ Courage “ for putting that high of a price the phone MUST be Super Perfect and yet here we are,YouTube
12,One more.. Why can't they put a close all apps button like EVERY android has on it??? Like really.. Just add one button.. Done..,YouTube
13,For 1000 pounds  i consider people's who buy this phone as iSheeps.,YouTube
14,It's a closed system. You can't request for it.,YouTube
15,"I'd rather have my Samsung Galaxy S8+. A MUCH better phone, with all the features Apple touts on the iPhone X, yet it only cost me $19.80 per month! Not $1000!!! What a RIP OFF!!! And, side by side comparisons of the 2 phones shows the S8+ beats the X hands down in nearly every way. Sorry Apple Fanbois, Apple is STILL playing catch-up, and they are not doing a good job of it at all!!!",YouTube
16,I have none of these issues on my Galaxy S 8 hahaha. ???,YouTube
17,Glad i've finally seen a honest video now of just how crap the iphone X trully is. I still can't get my head round just how small or teeny the iphone x is...i'm just glad i'm sticking with my Samsung Note 8..100 times a better phone then the x or any in the apple range.?,YouTube
18,I think you misspoke when explaining true tone(1:18). Shouldn't the display turn warmer when in a warmer environment?,YouTube
19,"I'll just keep my s7 edge for another year,  works like new btw",YouTube
20,"Damn you forgot about the major problem, the notch... or was it Siri being garbage?",YouTube
21,Do you really need to read all the way down to the buttom of the screen? Just curious as you said that the bar on the buttom is an issue. Is it not normally you look at your eye level when reading and slide it up to continue reading.,YouTube
22,Why this video doesn’t let me expand the image to full screen on my iPhone X?,YouTube
23,"Your technical description of EIS vs OIS is flawed, and speaks to a lack of experience in software development for consumer products.",YouTube
24,Sorry mate but your talking complete bullshit! 4hrs of charge for the first few cycles! Come on mine lasts a whole day straight out of the box. Also the battery percentage is right there if you slide down from the right! Shows how much effort you put into all those issues!,YouTube
25,Best video on this crap phone well done..... Sticking to my IPhone 7plus. New subscriber to your channel.,YouTube
26,yeah my next phone will most likely be a galaxy,YouTube
27,So glad I went from an iPhone 7 to a Note 8,YouTube
28,You have 8 5.8 display and you’re worried about a ¾ inch long maybe 5mm wide line blocking text at the bottom of the screen?. Really? I get maybe it could disappear like it does it movies and videos but it’s really not that in the way. That’s ridiculous.  I’ve had zero issues with how you’re describing True Tone.   Also your issue with the telephoto OIS is because of how they use the telephoto lens. In low light they digitally zoom the wide angle lens in because it has a lower aperture(more light enters the lens). The telephoto is only really used in good lighting. Therefore the fact it’s not used as much means they don’t keep the lens constantly stabilized until it’s being used and determined by the camera it’s in a well enough lit situation to be used  With the exposure controls you must have something like auto HDR on. If you have ANY auto feature on it will over ride your manual control of the image.  All of the glitches I’ve experienced have been due to third party apps not being upgrade for the phone. Haven’t had any on the OS itself from average usage.   Also my battery has been quite insanely good. I’m at 55% with over 4 hours use and nearly 10 on standby. You easily will get better batter than on any plus. The early battery life issues are from average drain setting up the phone. Installing apps and playing with the device more than you would on average. That happens whenever anybody gets a new phone usually. Even with that it took nearly a full day installing apps downloading movies and tv and getting settings right to get me under 40% even.   I have yet to notice auto brightness at all. It works how it does on any device. Most of the time it’ll  never brighten automatically above even 85% or so. Colors don’t change any ever either.  Battery percent is useless. If you really need a percent just go to the control center. I’ll keep having the WiFi cellular signal and time any day over the battery percent of my phone.  Don’t really see any of these as issues really.   My issues have been with devs being slow to update apps when they’ve had a month to at least. Most devs says it only even takes a few days at most to update for full X support. Not that difficult.,YouTube
29,For 1000 quid I expect damned perfection,YouTube
30,That shirt is nice,YouTube
31,"My special note 8 gt, is so good I don't need a iPhone x..",YouTube
32,I have an iPhone 7 Plus. Since update to 11.1 my battery drains like crazy.,YouTube
33,I k ow how to fix all of those issues..... note 8,YouTube
34,For problem 4.  Turn off HDR,YouTube
35,I turned off TrueTone as soon as I got my iPhone X. Otherwise it’s too yellow brownish. I have experienced a few software glitches so far. Haven’t really tried out all the functionality of the cameras yet.,YouTube
36,i have a ton of problems with animoji its extremely laggy on my phone and dosen’t work properly like the one displayed on the store the eyes seems to move by themseves without me moving them they move constantly up and down. is anyone else having this problem..?,YouTube
37,The battery percentage is there when you open control center,YouTube
38,"I hate where the new control centre is, it’s so hard to get to",YouTube
39,here's how to fix all the problems with the iPhone x just buy a Galaxy Note 8 it's way better LOL,YouTube
40,"would you look at the battery life issues with the iPhone 7 running iOS 11.1? It's super annoying, and no one is talking about it.",YouTube
41,"Remember that iPhone is the best!!! I bought Oneplus 5. It costs only 600$ less than iPhone X and works completely fine without any bugs... And It has better battery life, quicker charging, fingerprint reader, headphonejack, 8gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage and dual sim slot. It is also thinner and lighter than iPhone X (And still has headphonejack)",YouTube
42,"Not only iPhone X but whole Apple eco-system is being fucked by IOS 11. It's  software issue which will be addressed soon so no point of picking flaws on iPhone X. My iPad mini 4, iPad pro & iPhone 7 was beast in ios 10 but after ios 11 its buggy & slow I feel it. The problem is IPhone X lunched in worst time that's all no point of making videos for this.",YouTube
43,My Galaxy S7 Edge does the magic waiting for S9 next year.,YouTube
44,"The landscape keyboard has lost and all it’s extra little features that IOS 10 had like the comma, ! ,  rt. & lt. buttons to place the cursor etc. It’s lost those extra features starting at the iOS switch from 10. and now it’s identical to portrait mode keyboard ?? And... while using “speech to text” it should return to the main keyboard so you can hit return and not back to the microphone. There again...more additional steps???",YouTube
45,1440p Squad,YouTube
46,Good review?,YouTube
47,Easy fix for iPhone 10 problems. Don’t buy one ?,YouTube
48,Surprised this video doesn’t have more dislikes,YouTube
49,I thought he was using an android at the beginning in the video lol,YouTube
50,Listen my iPhone 3 g has none of those problems that's why I didn't upgrade :),YouTube
51,Best way to fix your iPhone x.....throw it against the wall and buy a Samsung,YouTube
52,"You do realize that the camera's are slightly apart from each other, so that while focused on a close object the transition to the telephoto lens won't be smooth?",YouTube
53,"Every apple fan uses the 'androids are laggy' argument, but every iphone and ipod I've ever owned has had more problems than any android I've had. Videos will shrink down to the corner of the screen when put into landscape mode, battery life is always crap. The more software updates the laggier it gets, camera app crashes, other gaming apps crash. It's not as 'smooth' as apple claims it to be. Android can crash apps after a long time of use (I'm talking a few years) but even iphones do.",YouTube
54,I already returned my X,YouTube
55,I still don't understand how Apple can fool people by pricing a phone at 1000 usd and people still buy it. Why did they do the iPhone 8 in the first place? I feel iphone 8 is only a tool to increase their future flagship prices. I really wana know if the price of iPhone 11 is going to be 850 or 1000. Ridiculous.,YouTube
56,I'm sorry but I can't concentrate on nothing you're saying because of your overwhelmingly asymmetrical nose...,YouTube
57,"It's a $1200 beta phone, it's like a Kickstarter, so what did you think.",YouTube
58,Has anyone had any problems with the iPhone x pocket dialling? I keep my iPhone in my top pocket and it has pocket dailled  6 times in the last 2 days. I tried disabling the touch screen to wake feature but didn’t work and I noticed the screen constantly wakes whenever in moves around in my pocket.,YouTube
59,This is why it’s stupid to buy on release day,YouTube
60,I’ve had my 10 since launch day and I’ve had non of these problems,YouTube
61,X lasts longer than 8plus,YouTube
62,Why the hell you’ve bought it? Get a Samsung and move on.,YouTube
63,THE NEW NOTE 7 LOLOLOLOL (IPHONE X),YouTube
64,Stick with iPhone 7plus or 8 plus. I have both and have no problems,YouTube
65,"My battery life with iPhone X was terrible, and I mean bad the first day or two. Like half a day of battery life with constant use, which my iPhone 7 Plus could handle much more easier. I was pissed, so now I’m hoping it gets better.",YouTube
66,My question is why are people happy to buy an iphone??,YouTube
67,Mine just opens apps with me touching the screen is so annoying,YouTube
68,you fool   optical image stabilization does not work for 2x zoom its only for 1x,YouTube
69,Does anybody  I phone x gets warm under the camera  consistently,YouTube
70,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moDmsNmOnPU,YouTube
71,"Closing apps and lousy face recognition are also issues, I already have my hand on the device so why not keep the finger print sensor? Now I have to key in my PIN way too often like years back with the iPhone 5 !",YouTube
72,I just love my flawless Galaxy S8 ahhhh,YouTube
73,Wallpaper?,YouTube
74,I had issues like unresponsive displayed. This is the second unit i returned back.. and i will never buy apple product again.,YouTube
75,"This is fucking prototype which rushed away.My X’s battery charges for over 4 hours, opens by itself when its shutted and warms up really quickly.I regret having this shit",YouTube

79,Solved my problems!! Got a Note,YouTube
80,"I actually have a problem with it , I just bought it couple weeks ago and when I watching some YouTube videos for a long time, the screen turns off with no reason. I will definitely return it ?",YouTube
81,I know it since launching. It has a black spot called notch.,YouTube
82,Or the line could be come transparent ( they should give us the ability to adjust the opacity of the line)...... I didn’t have ANY of these issues. Even my first cycle I ran it all day and into the night with during the first cycle. Your phone may  issues.   Well the Battery % is valid.    No one ever mentions that you can more easily accidentally take screen shots. Yu can happen when you’re trying to take the phone in and or out of your pocket (mostly pants pocket)   Thanks for the video. I just didn’t have any... well I had one issue but the % thing isn’t a bug it’s just a feature they should have never messed with.,YouTube
83,"Somewhere i said the notch isnt that annoying, but i notice now in vids it does distract me.",YouTube
84,Wow! That's too many bugs.,YouTube
85,Anyone else experiencing buzzing sounds from earpiece ? especially when loudspeaker is on,YouTube
86,agree,YouTube
87,Man sorry to hear that but I'm both iOS and android user I think both got problems android has their nfc problem near a credit card and pop up is a ton even with Adblock/adblockplus so nothing is perfect,YouTube
88,The biggest problem with iPhone X is having an iPhone X at the first place. ?,YouTube
89,"IMO, True Tone is bs full stop. It’s turned off on my pas because it changes the tone o match the room but whilst doing so, it destroys the tone of the image so you cannot edit images accurately. That’s a no from me",YouTube
90,How to start a Fight  Apple is better than samsung,YouTube
91,"and why doesn't the ios gives some signal warnings when battery is almost depleted like in androidOS  , the iphone dies silently and you have no clue.",YouTube
92,I like the actual numeric digital display on the battery indicator too!!!  I would like to just wake up my phone and see a numeric percentage on the battery indicator rather than having to have to go through a process to get to an actual numeric readout on the battery Icon!!!,YouTube
93,don’t by x waste of money,YouTube
94,People wake up....i phones are over rated,YouTube
95,You guys work like a mad man then you give all your money to mega rich companies??,YouTube
96,Great job im still debating on getting it...,YouTube
97,great job..wallpaper link pleasee.,YouTube
98,Is that a alien on Jurassic park sgirt?,YouTube
99,You can see the battery percentage when you swipe down to the control center.,YouTube
100,"iPhone X was overhyped product that was incomplete and rushed.   The Apple PR engine is trying their hardest to ensure that narrative never surfaces.  Which is why they gave early access to YouTubers but for their initial video you can see a pattern that seems like an influencer contract had more in it than just a release embargo.  Now that the timing for things like that has passed we are finding out about the experience after launch day hype is over and first impressions videos are done...  I’m not blaming reviewers for this. I have their back on this, the industry has to change and be more transparent.  I went to the Apple Store for launch weekend and tried the phone all day filmed it and talked to real Apple users not from the tech world.  They had frustrations and many chose to stay on their older phone or get the 8 Plus.  Price wasn’t the issue for them.  This product was very much Flash and no substance and not intuitive to use.  Doing something “revolutionary” doesn’t always work.  But the marketing for this product is fantastic and commercially it’s a success in the ways that matter in business.",YouTube
101,"""iphone x display"" tag is ranked #10 Jon!!!!  Great SEO.  I just bought the iPhone X for my son.  I told him if he breaks it he is on his own.",YouTube

119,"1. ios 11.2 fixes the ""I"" character issue. This is the OFFICIAL fix. 2. all OLED displays have burn in susceptibility.  Including Samsungs. If yours hasn't then its still coming. 3. Apple designed OLEDs and Samsung built them.  Samsung does not have a say on the design, they just build from given specs.   I like the humor in this channel. I just don't like misinformation and un-fact checked stuff, especially if you call your channel a media/news outlet. It turns into a 'hate-video'. unless if you make it clear that you hate Apple from the start, then cool.  and yes, I am an apple fan, and yes i am biased. but not stupid.",YouTube

Scenario 2: Haha your iPhone X display is suffering from burn in. Sheep: Oh that's because Apple is using Samsung displays in their phones.  iDiots",YouTube
136,"IT IS an OLED issue, Galaxy displays have around same amount of blue shift and burn in potential as the iPhone X, but the Pixel really is much worse than both due to LGs shit quality  control.

154,"Who is this cretin and why does he keep appearing in my recommended feed. The issue with the letter “I” has already been fixed in 11.2 and Apple has stated that they’ll have a software fix for the bug. The statement about oled screens was more of a legal manoeuvre in my eyes, ALL oled panels are susceptible to burn-in and/or image retention. It’s down to the software to mitigate this but it has and will happen to even the best Samsung displays in the years to come.  If you’re going to be an Android sheep at least name your channel to reflect this.",YouTube
155,This is probably a result of Apple own doing to bring up the contrast and brightness so people can say how great their display look even though it is literally a lower resolution Samsung display.,YouTube

193,I think Samsung did it on purpose who knows?? but I'm so happy that this problem is happening to Apple  I hope that it will continue like that I wish for more and more problems for Apple burn Apple burn 1000$ emoji phone what a fuching joke,YouTube
194,"This is possibly the result of the reported tweaking by apple of Samsungs screen that  Displaymate reported. In that review it gives no credit for the screens performance by Samsung, its all credited to apple as though the article is an apple advert, sidelining Samsung. It is to be hoped that the press is as generous in attributing to apple, the resultant error, in meddling with the screen parameters, possibly to levels responsible for this. With it being a 5.35 inch screen, with two little bat ears, either side of the tracker, its not a 5.85 inch screen either. I wonder if there is a real review anywhere that is not sponsored by apple we could look at, in deciding on this phone, although, having seen real world video that it is not quicker than that note 8, I'm feeling that cut out has eliminated it for me, even without the other problems that  are now starting to pop up. Good video, but filler much to long, nearly ditched before main story.",YouTube

196,I phone X was originally scheduled for 2018 but Tim Cook forced the production to be rushed to coincide with the 10th Anniversary of the i Phone 2g anyway substandard products will not do i demand  THE RESIGNATION OF TIM COOK !!!

199,They did send out an update to fix it though man. Other then that great video.,YouTube
200,If you’re a samsung oneplus or any brand of phone pls don’t watch this because you gonna hate or just advertise your great phone in your perspectives,YouTube
201,It sound like old Morse code,YouTube
202,Holy return it ASAP,YouTube
203,Silver or space gray? I personally prefer the silver,YouTube
204,"With MILLIONS of iPhones being manufactured by thousands of techs, it is reasonable to assume that some of the total will not be 100% correct.  With a small amount of defects, such as, your experience showing up Apple does a great job with correcting the situation with a new, proper replacement.  I have the X and love it, and if I had experienced what your video shows I would not have liked it either.  But, I also would have recognised the volume manufacturing defect issue potential, and lived with a replacement.  After your inconvenience I hope you are now happily enjoying the great features of this phone.  Cheers from the UK.",YouTube
205,Return it,YouTube
206,Lack of quality control. This should not of gotten thru. Apple is clearly slipping on quality control the last few years.,YouTube
207,"I don't buy much apple no more due to reasons but what I do know is they will fix there issues ever phone has problems samsung, apple, HTC, etc",YouTube
208,Got the Samsung ad dissing apple before this lol,YouTube
209,????????.,YouTube
210,I like it mine works fine,YouTube
211,Jut because you had an issue doesn't mean that it's a bad launch.,YouTube
212,I have the iPhone x and I have no problem Model: A1901,YouTube
213,Sometimes people drop their phones and pretend that never happened??,YouTube
214,"""Working for years!"" yea. right. This was done in may be a year.  If not faster",YouTube
215,Definitely a manufacturer defect there. Mine does NOT do that and yours shouldn't either.,YouTube

224,what kind of iphone is that ?? it look easy to broke and my iphone X is broke already i put hard case and the screen crack and i take out the case it doesent come off then it crack and the screenpop out i swap to iphone8 plus,YouTube
225,"All the apple haters here, I do not like Apple but of course some iPhones will have some sort of defects. There are millions of these phones being manufacturered not all are perfect condition",YouTube
226,I had that kind of problem with my 7 plus but the touchscreen still worked. My iPhone X is amazing though,YouTube
227,"Btw, how did you get the idea to start squeezing your phone this way? What was purpose of this move? In my entire life I never had a need to do what you did in this video? not once. for your info: You use smartphone, by sliding the touchscreen nowadays and gently pressing on it and it's the preferred way of using smartphones ;)",YouTube
228,IPhone is the worst phone I have ever seen and I think samsung is much better??,YouTube
229,"I noticed this issue on my iphone 5 before after some use, so I assume the way apple glue the screen is not secure enough, never had trouble with my i7 or my x ,which are the phones that I have taken more care of, still hope apple gonna use some better methods to mount their screen so I can surrender my money in peace. Like seriously if you wanna charge 1000 for a phone fine I'll buy it, but plz get the screen rightr",YouTube
230,"also the development process of apple probably involves coupe or couple dozen iphones being used repeatedly and tested, now it's millions of these phones shipping to ppl all over the world, it is not possible that every single one of these devices are perfect.",YouTube
231,No way the 5T is half the price of the note 8 and a lot faster. I love it,YouTube
232,Apple is shit,YouTube
233,iPhoneX is a major fail of the year.,YouTube

237,the screen on my ipod 6th generation pops like your iphone too,YouTube
238,It's normal for any smartphone to have a defected unit. Just return it for a new unit.,YouTube
239,I got the iPhone 8 instead I like it better than the iPhone X,YouTube

243,There’s Apple for ya,YouTube
244,Thank you! Glad I saw your video! Now I'm going to think twice about upgrading my iPhone 7 Plus to X!,YouTube
245,"Thank you for making this video..I had the same exact issue, so I did some research (googling) and found a bunch of people saying the same. Now when I go into Apple store (Meatpacking district, NYC) they acted brand new and as if they i was the only person having this issue. Thank god for nosey people, there were two college girls, (pretty hot btw) sitting directly in front of me when the same problem. Long story short, when this came to the attention of the floor supervisor they whisked us away to the back room. I had a very weird feeling that they didn’t want us on the main floor where others had already been walking up to us asking about what we were both talking about. She (supervisor) literally gave us two brand new iPhones X’s with a shit load of extras (phone cases, screen protectors, charging pad, etc) I have been an Apple’ite from the beginning when they had the original tin foil back and paid almost 900$ (500$ for the phone + 400$ deposit, for a new AT&T account) so I’m not knocking them, but that will definitely change if these little bullshit lies keep coming out.",YouTube
246,"Get the iPhone 8 Plus , I have it.... excellent phone.....",YouTube
247,"Idek what Apple happened this year... First came with horrible iOS 11, macos High Sierra, now even the iPhone X!? Gosh I miss the Steve Jobs Apple",YouTube
248,It might just need a software update ..well that's how apple always try to solve all their phone related issues..it's never a hardware problem.??????,YouTube
249,Apple definitely wasn't prepared to launch the iPhone x (and iOS 11.0 - 11.1) but I think your issue is isolated though.,YouTube
250,Well what do you expect? The display/screen was made by samsung.,YouTube
251,For now I’m happy with my 7 plus. I’ll just get an ipad air 2.,YouTube
252,Happens to me to,YouTube
253,Apple Gate,YouTube

255,I have zero problems works great,YouTube
256,That’s just yours an a few other fools that rushed for the hands on the first few phones.,YouTube
257,shit happens when u use samsungs stuff on your phones apple.. deal with it..,YouTube
258,I'm gonna dislike this video because youre insulting the corporation I like,YouTube
259,I phone x is trash,YouTube
260,"Dude, if you don’t like it, return it. If you do like it get it replaced. Nobody that makes anything has every single individual unit come out flawless. This isn’t an iPhone X problem. It’s your specific iPhones problem. Obviously the waterproof adhesive didn’t adhere properly.",YouTube
261,iPhone x sucks,YouTube
262,This is also happening to my iPhone X and only had for 2 days but appears to happen when I put my case on and when I take it off it’s works fine,YouTube
263,this happened to the iphone 6,YouTube
264,"I just got my ""X"" today (11.24).  I'll keep you posted.  I already know that I don't care for the fact that all my sports games make it now seem that I'm playing them on a iPhone 4!",YouTube
265,My beautiful 2017 samsung j7 pro 1week old made out of full metal drop 5 times not a scratch. ???,YouTube

274,Samsung for me,YouTube
275,My LG G6 is much better than this stupid craft.,YouTube
276,"Stupid consumerism, all you do with smartphones is merely texting, talking, taking pics, videoing and playing games...that's it! Do you need the latest crap available on the market (overpriced and lots of glitches to be found, like the one shown on this video)?  All of those features can be done with a device worth 1/15th of the iPhone X price.",YouTube
277,*(Laughs in Galaxy Note 5)*,YouTube
278,A lesson for tim cook,YouTube
279,Tippical Ishit X,YouTube
280,*I love iphone X* ??,YouTube
281,Lesson learned. Don't rush buying things because maybe some of them might have issues. Spend wisely tho. ?,YouTube
282,I enjoy Apple products as well as Android devices. I have used both platforms on numerous devices throughout the years. This new iPhone seems like way too many compromises and issues to be an upgrade from a previous model year. Glad I went with the S8+ and back to Android from my iPhone 7. I also agree that iOS 11 has been pretty buggy with so many freezes and app crashes on my 7. Apple really needs to put their focus back into their software and hardware instead of rushing things out to beat the competition.,YouTube
283,1:41 Top Notch build quality,YouTube
284,"I’ve had the X since launch day and I’ve had no real problems. Aside from that weird ‘A?’ bug that was fixed in a software update, it’s been a pretty smooth transition from the iPhone 7. I hope your replacement phone is much better!",YouTube
285,i think the most price worth is iphone 6,YouTube
286,So like every new device that launches there’s going to be some that have glitches... just return it and stop figuring out ways to bash Apple ?????,YouTube
287,"Anything that is mass produced in extremely large numbers will have duds here and there. It's naive not to think so. Luckily Apple will replace, swap or fix issues on the spot. It ain't that bad.",YouTube
288,How about returning it and get a replacement?,YouTube
289,Man buying my s8 is a god sent,YouTube
290,Makes me glad I got the 8 instead of the X.,YouTube
291,Mine too,YouTube
292,iphone 5/5s struggles,YouTube
293,Or it’s fake?,YouTube
294,Think you got a faulty model?,YouTube

296,I’ve had this exact phone for a month now and I’ve had zero issues. Nothing. No unresponsive touches. No clicking. No green line. I love mine.,YouTube
297,It sort of looks like you press down on the screen too hard ?,YouTube

399,I subbed to you let's goooooo,YouTube
400,This is what I thought as well. Most people who own iPhones only have it for the status of it. They fell hook line and sinker for the marketing.,YouTube
401,"Apple fans will never complain about how Apple fucks them over most of the time, they'll just accept it.",YouTube
402,"Look I understand that there is cheaper phones out there, but not everyone wants to deal with the android operating system. So it's not that easy especially if your deep into apple eco system like myself. I love the look of the note 8 but I don't like the Touch wiz on Samsung phones, and for me the note 8 is the only other phone that I would use other than the iPhone.",YouTube
403,At least Samsung give away free accessories like fast wireless charger 128 micro sd card or a 360 camera for your 929 note8 price  troubles,YouTube
404,Such an android fan boy,YouTube
405,Nope to the iPhone X,YouTube
406,IPhoneX doesn't include a lot of stuff like fast charging or more features without paying a lot more for the iPhoneX.  While the Note8 includes a lot of stuff and one of the FREE promotions that the Note8 has is a 256Gb SDcard and a wireless charging base that can be used like a stand,YouTube
407,"I got the Note 8n and I am so happy with It! Amazing device! The Apple ecosystem drives me nuts. It's a great operating system, just not for me. I'm and Android girl!",YouTube
408,#1 reason - Price for what you get. Outrageously expensive.,YouTube
409,6th reason : I CAN'T MOD IT,YouTube
410,Its only £60 more than galaxy note 8?? grow up man,YouTube
411,"I only need one reason not to buy it, its a iphone.",YouTube
412,RIP APPLE,YouTube
413,lol Iphone started glass back ?? not Samsung,YouTube
414,If note 8 is almost 1k why not Iphone x ?? this dude just hates iphones. My iPhone 7 plus cost almost 900 so I don't mind getting iphone x. Cheap people get android phones ?,YouTube
415,Gtfo! Don’t come telling me any reason why I shouldn’t buy the iPhone X since you are not going to pay for it. Fandroid,YouTube
416,"The fact the iPhone 7 obliterates the Note 8 in speed comparisons shows one massive reason you would get one that you fail to mention. That's performance, if The Note can't get close to last year's iPhone, why spend $939 on that. This will include iPhone 8 too, so iPhone 8 overwhelmingly embassies Note 8 in performance stakes, yet costs over dollars less. People in glass houses...",YouTube
417,I bet he is trying to get us not to buy it so HE can buy it,YouTube
418,"What you won’t get by getting other phones   Security, customer support, trendiness, better AR, better camera, and a few more",YouTube
419,"You could have worn that ""premium"" suit while making this ""premium"" video... ?",YouTube
420,Thanks bro. I hope you dissuaded a few potential buyers on iPhone X pre-order day. The less competition for that phone the better for me.,YouTube
421,"If I had a $1,000 to buy a phone, I would go for Samsung. Apple just loves to gouge people when they have to pay extra for faster recharging when everything should already be included with the phone. All glass? Don't even drop it once.",YouTube
422,"Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile have all reported lackluster iPhone 8 n 8 Plus sales so that pretty much already speaks to the success of the upcoming iPhone X.",YouTube
423,"I have been using iPhone since the 3gs, have the 7plus now and i will upgrade to the X. I do not have enough knowledge to say weather it’s better then any other phone or not, i just like it more! I hate the android os, don’t know why but we just can’t get along!! So i get that is expensive and all, but you can’t say IOS is bad, cmon...",YouTube
424,Poor guys must buy android,YouTube
425,"IPhone  $1000.00, not including taxes, phone service, case, screen protector and insurance... a price over $1500.00... a waste of money, every other phone that's cheaper does the same exact thing.",YouTube
426,"So, i'm only 1:34 mins into the video and i have already a problem. Yes, you are right, you can have a good phone for a LOT less! BUT, saying that you kinda have the same camera quality, sorry, no. A big no. First of all, this is the first phone that will do 4 @ 60fps, just let that sink in for a moment... Even saying it like : An incredible camera, yes, of course, but you never will have the same level of quality. Come on man.  The glass back, well, i'm guessing i'm the only one who really love the look of this? I actually didn't really like the Aluminum. I think the glass back is much nicer while it gives you also more grip and gives you wireless charging. So, that's (even if you don't like the looks of it) still 2 features that you actually should appreciate. And if you say: Well, i don't care about the grip cause i will have a case on it well then you also won't see the back of it do you? ;-)  Removing of touch id. Well, we people want less bezels (myself included) and we just want a beautiful screen to look at it. Well, how are you going to access and interact with it? You NEED to get rid of those buttons, there isn't a place for them anymore if you want only a screen to look at it. Now yes, it could be under the screen, but they weren't ready for that, (neither was Samsung btw), so i think we really should cut them some slack for that. Implementing it on the back would not have been beautiful or convenient imo. If you look at the back of the iPhone X, it's just a beautiful device. But that's a personal taste of course.  Face id: less intuitive? Nah man, I don't know if you (and people who read my comment) have looked at a hands on after show, and they showed multiple times how easy it actually is. I mean, if it's in your pocket, it doesn't need to be unlocked. If you take it out, it will already be awake because of (raise to wake), so the only thing you need to do is look at your phone (which you actually already need to do, because if you're unlocking it, it means you're going to look at messages or doing something on your phone), so i don't see how looking at your phone is even mentioned as a ""step"" to go into your phone. The only thing you need to actually do, is raise/tap to wake and then swipe up, which is honestly brutally fast...  You're going to have to Re-learn how you're gonna use your phone... Come on, really? A swipe up brings you to the home menu, every time, no matter where you are or what you're doing at that moment with your phone. A swipe up and holding it half a second will bring you in to multitask for viewing all your screens. Is that so hard? It's the only thing you will have to learn. Of course you need a new way to interact with a phone that only has a screen. Imo, the Samsung with that software button, that takes place for no reason... The only thing you need to do with that button is going to the homescreen. Nothing more, nothing less. I really can't see all this as really valuable points. But everyone has their own opinions of course. But i'm very sure, this is the way we will interact in the future with tablets and phones or other hardware that includes only screen/glass.  Oled screen: It looks like they wen't with the cheaper option. Let me tell you something, they are charging Apple $130 for a piece of glass that would cost around $30-$50. If they would have opt for an even better quality screen, how much would Samsung have asked to Apple for that? And no, it's not the fact that Apple can't pay it. But it's the fact that we, the consumers are getting charged and we will get the bill. And so here Apple said, no, and thank god they did because i don't want to think about how much that iPhone X would have cost otherwise. Yes, there are nicer displays on the market, but you will pay $930 (Note 8), which isn't a lot cheaper in the end then the iPhone X.  The headphone jack? Really? Again? Pixel 2 anyone...? Now, on the other hand, you are right about one thing, Apple is looking to go full wireless with their phones and this is why they slowly get rid of things. That's just the way it goes. They got rid of the floppy disk, cd-rom, headphone jack, sd card slot (which is actually the only thing i'm really mad about). And they will go as far as needed to achieve wireless in the end...  having said all this, there are things that bug me a bit. Like for example, we still have that camera bump, the notch on the front isn't my favorite thing either but i think i could live with it. I'm sure that in the future this is something they will get rid off completely but for now, we'll have to do with it.  Also, the price with 64GB is outrageous. I would have liked 128/256GB and that would have been a whole different story! But in the end, you buy what you like of course :-)",YouTube
427,HOW ABOUT PUT A CASE ON IT,YouTube
428,8:40 -> 9:10   True words!,YouTube
429,And that’s right Apple products retain the price more than other phones and practically every thing they sell. Buy a laptop used. How much they cost used. I sold my iPhone 6 last year for $500,YouTube
430,"iPhone fans don’t buy iPhones because we think it’s better with its mechanics...  We buy them for the status, and the simplicity...  Apples mechanics aren’t really better than the  competition and vice versa. They have some tweaks better and some Have better than iPhone. When it boils down all phones are the same in all reality.   We’re willing to spend an extra $100-$200 for a status and simplicity. Not because we think they’re more advance lol. Not sheep. Just willing to spend more money for same product with a better status than a generic droid lol",YouTube

451,So how much did Samsung pay you for this review?  Your facts are skewed a bit.,YouTube
452,"Where all being fooled, as far as I'm concerned Apple and Samsung is playing us all. There so deeply imbedded with each other that no matter which phone you prefer, no matter which phone you spending your hard earned money on these two companies are making money. Buy a IPhone, apple and samsung making money, buy a galaxy, apple and samsung making money. So how about we stop acting like Childish assholes( my phone better than yours, no my phone better than yours) and just let people buy whichever they like, because in the end apple and samsung is overcharging use and withholding tech year after year giving a little bit of this and a little bit of that so they keep selling us basically the same phones. car manufacturers do it,  tv manufacturers do it, these two companies are making billions . Ask yourself this: If a company was really your competition and you really was against them why would you be selling them your tech? You don't see two football team competing against each other letting the other one score ever now and then because the other team was paying them to! One that's illegal and two that would make it no longer a competition but it would be an enterprise, a company built on two teams working together to fool the public!!!",YouTube
453,Apple... Yesterday's tech at tomorrow's prices.,YouTube
454,"Dude!!! You left out the $84 additional tax to get fast charging which is ALREADY built into the phone. WTF!!! If you want the 256 GB and fast charging you have to spend $1200... A brand spanking new in the box Microsoft Surface Laptop, a full blown laptop with Core i5 processor, a QHD 13.5'"" TOUCH screen and twice the storage of the iPhone X is the same DAMN $1,000.... C'mon Apple... I guess it's milking season.",YouTube

456,"Have you any proof this is an inferior display? Just because the screen is bigger? In fact the iPhone is probably better as its pentile display uses all the LED where as the Note does not use all the LEDs (25% unused). I will leave it to the experts but they usually agree that the least important part of the quality of a display is it's resolution, from color gamut to tone, these things matter to the experts rather than juvenile spec junky, my screen is bigger than yours nonsense.",YouTube
457,Who else likes Samsung and Apple?,YouTube
458,"When you’re talking money and payment plans, if you’re not a teen relying on your parents. A 800 dollar phone vs the new IPhone is negligible. I like the emoji layout on the Iphone, the way the phone feels and all that hype, Samsung has always been a plastic phone that gets hotter than any phone I ever owned. All the phones do the Job, but its almost tax season, that plus the payment plan option makes you barely miss the cash. Some people spend theirs on other worthless commodities, Apple users on their phones....at the end of the day we could all get by with a 30 dollar flip phone. My old man has had the same flip phone 10 years and can make more money off of it than most people with “smart phones”. All smartphone buyers fell for the marketing and pretty displays, some are just jealous about the fact some people will blow their money on the I-Phone instead of the Samsung mom bought them.",YouTube
459,whatever wouldn't change my mind that i have an iPhone X upgraded of my iPhone 6 plus and am happy with my iPhone X period!!! lol :),YouTube
460,Ur face like my ass dude,YouTube
461,everyone in my class except me has one. I got an iphone 4s..really it is not even much different and I got it for only 300 dollars (not including the plan) .. I think the iphone x is not worth it,YouTube
462,This video is Gold!!!,YouTube
463,"Hi price, with the lil Wayne backdrop made me laugh... Great vid",YouTube
464,Screen flickers on apps like WhatsApp. Eye strain as well. Does anyone else has same issue of vibrating screen and flickering. No solution given by Apple care,YouTube
465,"nope, I'll stick with my Moto Z Play Droid better features and Overall better Performance as well, than the IPhone X when they ripped off the Android tech and bought Samsung screens like everyone else lmoa, might was well go with another ""Android has beating apple for a long time for at least 4 years""lol.",YouTube

467,Each to his or her own. Very bios review.,YouTube
468,"My S7 gave me no problems whatsoever.  My note4 had no problems either. In fact i only switched phones because we got a family pack upgrade deal. Apple sucks. I used to own one as well, but Apple has been showing a pattern of being late bloomers and behind with  development lately it obviously shows Apple is not superior phone but people buy it for status or a ""look what i got"" Device, and i say Yeah, Im looking at a sucker that overpaid for a NEW Iphone jam packed with older technology and features I had on my phone 2 years ago. Example ; how long was 3G out before the Iphone3GS came out? Long enough that ignorant people lined up trying to buy it, while me and other smartphone owners were walking around for 4-6 months with 4G phones. Didnt you people hear? THEY BOUGHT CHEAPY DISPLAYS FROM SAMSUNG!!! and retarded people still line up outside in the cold for em....smh' Screw Apple. Nuff said.",YouTube
469,You were speaking about price.... What about the Note 8?,YouTube
470,"iPhone X costs 1000 dollars for the notch on the top, the face ID and the talking pile of poo (a.k.a. animoji). And people are still defending it as worthy of all the bucks. That's the power of marketing and Apple have bested it for a long time now and the brainwashed fans have no time to see the truth.",YouTube

472,Jalne Vale jalte hai,YouTube
473,P,YouTube
474,Yes,YouTube
475,"About the fact that 'Apple went with the cheaper display' You do know that Samsung actually increased the price of the display for Apple yeah? Basically, if they wanted to go for the better option it would have cost them even a more unusual price and consequently making us pay even more for the phone. It's a business, and strategically speaking I would have gone for the cheaper option too, especially since the difference is not as visible as you think lol. Have you seen both phones next to each other in person?",YouTube
476,"""The gestures will take you 3 weeks up to a month to get used to the gestures, which would be a turn off"" I don't know how slow you are, but I got used to it in less than 5 minutes lol In fact, after a few days, I started swiping up on other phones (aka I got used to it easily)",YouTube

482,I have the X the day it came out! Loving it! No issues,YouTube
483,"First of all, i hate the cut off at the top. Also, this isnt the best display when you compare it with Galaxy Note 8. Iphone X can go upto only 625 nits while Note 8 can go upto 1200 nits",YouTube
484,Those phones are shit....... long live X,YouTube
485,"You forgot the biggest flaw, it has the same specs as the iPhone 8 Plus. The screen is not worth it as apps are not optimized and Touch ID us better than Face ID",YouTube
486,"Lol I’ve had all the iPhones, Samsung’s. Even the tablets. But in my opinion.. apple is better. They don’t lag, they are faster. Yes androids you can do more to the phone like customize it how ever you like. Yes they have good cámara, but for a daily bases, the apple products win.",YouTube
487,"I don't know why everyone is hating on the iphone x, yeah i know it's a little bit expensive but if it's not a problem then buy it because other then than is a pretty good phone (an if you want the headphone jack you can use the adaptor and keep it attached to your headphones like i do)",YouTube
488,If you work hard for your money and you want this phone I say get it. Just because other phones are cheaper doesn’t mean you should settle for something else that you don’t want. Yes it’s crazy expensive but some people buy a closet full of nice closes and shoes and others want a nice phone.,YouTube
489,why? no home button,YouTube
490,IPhone X looks like a toy phone with childish icons,YouTube
491,hi . i would like to point out about the software home button. there is actually one and it is called assistive touch. you can find it in the Settings. i have been using this feature since iphone4s.,YouTube

And seriously why on earth use something else than a fingerprint as your finger is already at the right place?? I picked now an Xperia XZ Premium Luminous Chrome and it's the elephant in the house, with custom recovery and ROOT.. Gosh, never more an iPh(censored)!",YouTube

503,"Some problems were legit, like optimization, the sides of my iPhone X don’t feel cheap and yes I’m returning mine because there are just too many issues for over $1k phone",YouTube
504,I'll just wait for the next Android flagship.,YouTube
505,"Totally agree!!!!!  I bought 2 , spent $2500 USD and both are going back to Apple.   Terrible screen size, feels like I own a standard size phone. Too bad because some stuff is cool.   Great review !!!",YouTube
506,I agree with you on the cost! Just way to expensive for the price.,YouTube
507,What do you mean iMessage has “space at the bottom where nothing is being used.” Imagine if the keyboard was way at the bottom of the screen. That would be more uncomfortable. Way more.   Wants wireless charging and an elegant (new) design - complains about glass back and lack of durability   Complains about apps not being fully optimized - iPhone X is on day 6  Expects a bezel free display like android - complains of video letter-boxing ( like on android)   Wants new tech in an iPhone and gets it - complains that it’s expensive (like every other Apple device)   Complains the phone feels cheap - forgets that iPhone 4 and 4s used same materials.     Like. Come on. Now we’re being nit picky.,YouTube
508,"Good to see an honest review, many other tech youtubers dont talk about the problems but suck apples d**k",YouTube
509,"Jesus Christ, what did u guys expect when y'all bought the phone.. of course it has many issues, it's the first generation of its kind... The only legit complaint in this vid is the price.. BTW Apple gave us the option of getting the iPhone 8 instead which has the similar features as the X",YouTube
510,Are you still giving out stuff?,YouTube
511,I'll give you 10 bucks for it.,YouTube

515,Does he even breath,YouTube
516,Nothing else to say but TRUE,YouTube
517,"i really don't see how it is so expensive, first of all it uses one of the most advanced operating systems out there, second the screen is OLED made by Samsung which of course they are going to charge them a lot for it, finally it has Face ID which took years to develop. When you buy a Macbook are you going to complain about how much it costs... NO because it's a computer and it doesn't even have Face ID or and OLED display and yet it costs more then $1500 dollars.",YouTube
518,"Apple I'm ready to buy the I-phone X but, there seems to be a few negatives highlighted. Apple this doesn't look good ! If I'm prepared to spend 1,350 Euros on an other Apple product  I really do expect this particular product to be flawless. Seriously !",YouTube

522,"Look... ?’m sorry for the troubles u had with this phone. But, when u said the cost is a problem i didn’t know what to say. Apple makes a 270$ profit per iPhone X. And let’s say Samsung s8... The Samsung s8 makes a 450$ profit. So the only reason it is this expensive is because it is made with premium materials",YouTube
523,Lmao this is really petty,YouTube
524,"I feel bad for apple, they're trying to catch up with samsung ASAP and this happends. Also razer's phone have better specs and feel and also $300 cheaper. Man i really feel bad for the company. Sorry Steve your hard work is gonna be wasted if they continue this.  Edit: just heard that iphone X cost $370 to make....",YouTube

Optimization is perfect for me(I pretty much only use large apps that are good about updates), the frame “feel” can be solved with a case, etc.  You act like there are good alternatives but honestly not many people who want the iPhone X want a Samsung or pixel. There are many people that are in the apple ecosystem(myself included) that don’t want to leave for a crummy Samsung",YouTube

540,One of your Subscribers From Dubai ??,YouTube
541,And think about how many glitches the iPhone “X” is going to have with no home button. The point is apple always in every every every single commercial for a new phone says “THIS IS THE BEST PHONE WE’VE EVER MADE” and then they explain how they changed the phone and act like it’s so great. Like for real. Also the iPhone 8 was rushed to get to the ten. Like apple listen you are failing at keeping up with new features - and getting ride of good ones (ahem headphone jack) and so because of this if you watch the flow of updates for phones - you can only have your iPhone for 3 years then get a new one because of the updates get ride of phones that are 3+ years older. Just look at what happened with the iPhone 5’s and IOS 10,YouTube
542,I have recently got the IPhone X and on YouTube you can zoom in and it makes it larger,YouTube
543,"It pisses me off how ungrateful some of these people really are. Right now someone is dying to even have the opportunity of getting the iPhone X and you’re sitting there complaining. Don’t be selfish. Of course the phone is gonna have some problems at first, it literally just came out... nothing is perfect. Like you and everyone else is saying Apple will end up fixing the issues.",YouTube
544,we developers are tired to have to optimize apps for apple is not worth it most of the apps will stay like that apple eventually will disapear anyway because is not been better any product gets worse so i think apple will dissapear 3 years from now.,YouTube
545,"I’ve been able to repair every iphone so far, but this one and the 8. That glass on the back makes it impossible.",YouTube

547,I love my iPhone X.,YouTube
548,"New features??? You apple users don't ever look around about what other companies are doing! For example, the ""brand new Face ID"" is on my 4 year old Samsung Galaxy tab 3! And the iPhone doesn't have a headphone jack, finger print scanner, auto stabilization for BOTH cameras, and still has the same battery life as the iPhone 5s!!!  (1900 milliamps= about 6 hour life) For $1000, ITS PURE TRASH!!",YouTube
549,"So what do we do if we want such a nice looking ambled display but want iPhone because it works seamlessly between our iPad and MacBook, why couldn't Apple have just made the 8 Plus's display as good :/",YouTube

To you know the time when the phone of each and every i-diot look exactly the same? Look how they got widgets, live wallpapers etc. like Android! Do you know the time, when the i-diots told you, that IPS displays are much better the AMOLED displays, because the IPS displays have such nice pale colors?

Have you seen everythingapplepro's durability test (by the way he is biased to android..) 4. You are not paying for 1200 dollars instantly, you are paying per month. The price is not as bad as it first seems. People complain about the Sensor Housing, or notch, on the top. There is room to put your battery, wifi signal, time, and you have more screen, and everyone complains. everyone is such a crybaby compared to 1990 when people did not complain about the smallest things. Now people complain about getting more. How about you go live on the street and know what it is like to complain?",YouTube

582,You shouldn’t even have to touch the frame you should have a case on that thing idc how much prime material your missing,YouTube
583,These problems are why I will always be an Android user,YouTube
584,"Optimization is issue on newest androids as well  Apps don’t fill screen on galaxy s8, s8+ or note 8 either, gotta stretch out apps and loose content in apps as well  And they have side bezels same as well",YouTube
585,Just sell your phone and go lol us X users that love the phone don’t care!!,YouTube
586,"Yeah I love my iPhone X , the only bitch is the zoom box keeps coming up and it won’t go away or the box to close it. That’s all that drives me crazy.",YouTube
587,"The most brittle phone ever.. Apple guaranty that the oled display us durable...WTF.. just fell of my pocket and shattered... contacted the apple customer service end up sending it to apple appointed service provider with the most hidden cost quotation..??.. WTH.. Clause “ replacement of the screen cost for about 2k MYS, should apple replace my device, i need to pay another 1.5k MYS.. WHATTT.. i dont need the device replace nor apple should decide to replace it and the so call service provider should take the advantage of marking up the problem and gain.... i had my casing and tempered glass on when it shattered.. it s wow...paying a thousand buck for the phone and intentionally making the screen so brittle is so blood sucking thing to do when you are a sincere fans..ive had note 3 and 4..iphone 5s and all those is so durable for expensive phone and that how apple build the most expensive phone",YouTube
588,"If you're going to review a phone, at least say the phone name correctly. It's ""iPhone ten"" not ""iPhone ex""",YouTube
589,Where to sell iPhone X?,YouTube
590,"I was an iPhone guy for ten years until apple killed my iPhone with updates. I got a cheap Android phone as a temp phone until I could get the latest and greatest iPhone when it came out. Yeah...I still have the cheap Android phone because it turned out to be better than the iPhone I replaced it with. Hell it's better than this overpriced POS! My cheap Android phone doesn't suffer from image burn in, color shift, frozen touch screen in cold weather, green lines of death on the screen, speaker crackling, or shitty battery life. It functions flawlessly AND it still has a headphone jack, sdcard, removable 3,000 mAh battery that last me several days instead of several hours like every iPhone I ever had. Your phone costs over $1,000 and it has ALL these problems that my $50 phone doesn't. What does that say about Apple? What does that say about you?? Guess what, when my phone breaks, it's not going to cost $500 to fix it. I can throw my sim and sdcard in a new one for $50 and be up and running like nothing ever happened in about as much time as it took to type this. In fact I can replace my phone 20 times for the price of yours, but I won't need to because it doesn't have a fragile glass back and it's got gorilla glass 4 on the front that I haven't managed so much as a scratch so far!! Yeah it's cheap, yeah it's a trash phone, but it still works better than yours.. I'm sure I'll get another flagship phone soon, but I'll be damned if it's going to be an iPhone! Ha ha, chump!!",YouTube

Its like saying hey my fingerprint got a part of the skin sanded and i cant get in with touch ID. Get what i mean? Your videos can be improved with better content knowledge that is more technical by doing more research and understanding the technology itself. Overall your video representation is pretty solid but there r room for improvement as you earn more and have better budget for better content.

616,A $1149 pre-release version of a mighty emoji machine made by the leader of a second-hand technology - Apple.  You wasted your money on tis piece of iShit and now you are whining. Should have check some videos before investing that crazy amount of cash on a 2009 device.,YouTube
617,"Note to the reviewer. Keep the phone in focus and stop moving it around because it is very hard to see what you are doing. You can keep it on a stand or place it flat on the table. Just my advice, thanks.",YouTube

634,sorry for bad words,YouTube
635,After 12 hours of use: unlock feature needs to be as fast than Touch ID. Closing apps needs to be easier. Keyboard bezels too antiquated for 2017 (iPhone 7 UI interface is better).  I am not a big fan of the True Tone and the big screen is something I’m gonna have to get use to.,YouTube
636,"Thank you for your review! But for the future, could you please stop shaking that phone when you’re about to make a point? Idk if it is just me but I found that very annoying!",YouTube
637,If you open the control centre the network name is there. Sounds that you have more problems with your cell network provider then iPhone X (10). Maybe you should change your wallpaper from a blue background then it might not be so blue,YouTube
638,"Since the IPhone X is sold out around the world, how about you sell me your iPhone X for 1200. That way you can go back to using  your old iPhone with the lower contrasted, less sharp but higher brightness so your friends can sit next to you and enjoy looking at your phone off angle a little better.  This solves that MAJOR problem for you, you get 1200 bucks from me and I get my hands on an iPhone X.   Do we have a deal, I’ll send you my address.   SMH...FOH<——",YouTube
639,Sounds more like complaining than problems lol,YouTube

Second the iPhone 8’s max nit brightness is 650 nite and the iPhone X’s max is ALSO 650, and honestly, from my experience it seems a bit brighter than the 8. Face ID is one first generation so you gotta give it some time, it’s wayyyyyyy more advanced than any other version of facial recognition on a phone and much more secure, and why would you go back to a 3GS just because Face ID doesn’t work sometimes that’s illogical, Touch ID fails sometimes like when your hands are wet and Face ID fails when you have shit on your face that’s not normal, so please post a video with intelligent downfalls of this phone because there are some, but it’s still an amazing phone",YouTube
648,Suk shit,YouTube

Don’t use the phone for a day and jump to YouTube to complain about problems when the x doesn’t work like the 7. The oled screen is better than the lcd. Apple designed this screen very well.,YouTube
653,Mine has a bug in video. When I play back video there is a few seconds of loud hiss it the beginning.,YouTube

756,Happen to my 3 day old iPhone X,YouTube

763,"Please see the OUTLINE in description to skip around, it's a long video!",YouTube
764,"Love this lol I still love my polerizer screen I no longer have to take my sunglasses off , it's great !! Oh man time to rag on bluegate everywhere so apple fans boys that apple is not perfect , in fact I'm waiting for next iOS when that 1000 phones start bugging out ,like iOS 11 while my 9.0 Android will be flawless like 8.0 in fact made it better with first update",YouTube
765,"At least your reviews seem objective enough.  I still think its overblown and this is an perfect example of that.  People were calling for recalls because of the shift on the XL2 but on the X it is perfectly fine?  I get it, maybe its worse but holy lord did it get blown out of proportion.  Also I think Googles QC is at fault since there are many reports of the blue shift being way better on some devices than others.",YouTube
766,That Pixel 2XL display is terrible. For most of the video they top of the display was blue and the bottom want simply because of the very slight off angle,YouTube
767,Hi jeff. I'm a big Samsung fan loving my note 8. This looks a nice phone. Where would you say the iPhone x ranks amongst all the top phones on display?,YouTube
768,"Thanks sir, I enjoyed your neutral & objective explanation as an Android fan, even listening as an Android fan.  I personally dig blue tinted/cool screens. Blue lights, blue whatever, anything blue (^_-)-?   I dig my pixel? The screen isn't nearly as bad as others make it out to be.",YouTube
769,"Blah blah blah... Who care if pixel 2 xl and note 8 are larger than iPhone x? Note has much bigger screen, and pixel 2 xl has bigger screen and front firing speakers.  Apple with all the wasted screen estate near all curve screen areas (notice extra white space on the top above time and battery indicator, and extra space taken by navigation control at the bottom) .  Design for the sake of design rather than design for function/purpose.",YouTube
770,"I didn't enjoy it, I want my time back! .... Jk :)",YouTube
771,"The Note 8 has no noticeable blue shift.  Apple can't hide behind some release notes on that, it's a lower quality display.",YouTube
772,"I have the Pixel 2 XL, the only way you see the blue tint is if you hold the phone horizontal with the screen facing up. No one looks at their phone that way while using it. The blue tint is not an issue.  Also, At&t iPhones are carrier locked, the same with Sprint. You will only be able to use a T-MOBILE sim if the phone is paid off.",YouTube
773,The blue shift was a complete problem on the pixel and now here is the blue shift again on iPhone X and it's not a problem because it takes a extra second or two to happen.... people like you call the blue shift a defect but on apple it normal..... anyways I'm glad I have a mind of my own because I'm a just in love with my Panda Pixel 2 XL right now.  PS the iPhone X is gorgeous to me...but I'm just not done with Android yet. ???,YouTube
774,$1000 for the phone and it doesn’t come with AirPods...? Still preordered it tho.,YouTube
775,Still those bezels on iPhone X r huge for a edge to edge screen,YouTube
776,Turn on the true tone display and test.,YouTube
777,Yes blame samsung lol,YouTube
778,T-Mobile is very spotty here. AT&T simply works in MANY more places.,YouTube
779,They both get blue at the same time. You are just telling yourself it doesn't lol.,YouTube
780,Never a problem when Apple has issues fan boys are the worst,YouTube
781,It looks like LG and Samsung are making sure they keep the best crop of screens...And rightfully so.,YouTube
782,Wow.. I really thought the iPhone would be brighter.. Are these at full brightness?,YouTube
783,What’s gonna happen when no android uses headphones ? Lol you android fanboys are gonna die,YouTube
784,"Honestly, I think when Google finally updates the Pixel 2 XL to have a more vivid color's option. It'll give the screen a warmer color, eliminating most of the blue shift.",YouTube
785,"What a dork, all that size comparison between different phones but he didn't even bother to turn both screens on and also compare screen size. :-/",YouTube
786,I hate how google got screwed over by LG,YouTube
787,You need to get ur hands on the razer phone. Its probably the best phone of 2017,YouTube
788,"I have a 2 XL in Panda. Love my phone. Apple users are using Face ID. I can just say ""Okay Google"" to unlock my phone with it being 8-10 feet away from me and asleep. Or I can summon my assistant while driving. I've asked Google Assistant to turn on bluetooth, pause or skip a video being cast to my 75 inch Sony tv, and take a screenshot! She can do it all. The AI on the Pixel 2 XL is no gimmick like animojis. I didn't realize the Assistant could do so much.",YouTube
789,Nice boring device.,YouTube
790,I love wallpaper on pixel 2 any link?,YouTube
791,"It is not a blue shift, look at those displays through CPL and you will see why that LG display has different angle color.",YouTube
792,skip to 09:40 to go to the comparison.,YouTube
793,10:00 mark for actual burn in discussion.,YouTube
794,I have zero issues with the display on my pixel 2 xl after a month of use,YouTube
795,Hey Jeff I was wondering if you have had any problems with burn in on the iPhone X? I am think of get one. I would be using it for the GPS and  streaming football games. So do you t Think  I would get a burn in when using like google maps? I do not keep my  brightness  up high. So you think that if you where to get a burn in that Apple would cover it in Apple care ? Thanks for the advice.,YouTube
796,"True Tone on the iPhone 8 Plus was great, but on the iPhone X it’s absolutely horrible. The color shifting is so bad with True Tone on the iPhone X.",YouTube

803,"Now this is a completely biased as usual apple fanboy comparison. Both has blueish screen, only difference is for apple you have to move a little further. These 2 phone has same shitty issue. Get outa here isheep idiot.",YouTube
804,"Talk about some serious hypocrisy.  Everyone had a lot to say about the Pixel 2 XL's screen but now that the iPhone X has some of the same problems, it is totally fine.",YouTube
805,Jeff Awesome Review and absolutely enjoyed Thanks so much for sharing I picked up some of the things you pointed out When seeing other people reviews Thanks so much for sharing Deb ??,YouTube
806,As much as I dislike Apple for some reason. I prefer the X. I like design and such things. The Pixel just looks gross. XD,YouTube
807,Anyone who puts their $1000+ phone in a $5 hunk of plastic needs to go to the gulag.,YouTube
808,lol the iphone is not even on 100% brightness,YouTube
809,11 point 1,YouTube
810,Why would you do this vid BEFORE installing the iOS update?  Just plain stupid man ?,YouTube
811,"Thanks for doing... No plans on getting one, but will be waiting for the full review...",YouTube
812,I tried the Pixel XL and gave it up after 3 days. The display was just awful and auto brightness would jump to much. On the iPhone X and very happy with it so far. Not 100% perfect but very happy with it.,YouTube
813,"THE CHANCE OF AN OLED TO NOT HAVE A BLUE SHIFT OFF AXIS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, why is everyone saying its a problem, i dont FUCKING get it.",YouTube
814,this is an AD for the cases?,YouTube
815,What are you catching on film? I thought you shot digital video?,YouTube
816,I've never liked LG. It's always been inferior to other top manufacturers in my experience. Google shouldn't have cheaped out.,YouTube
817,"Pixel 2 XL might look blue, but iPhone X looks orange. (I'm used to my Galaxy A5 display ?)",YouTube
818,So tech 21 bought you the IPHONE X with free cases?,YouTube
819,Pixel 2 xl blue screen definitely deal breaker especially at $1000,YouTube
820,Blue shift does not happen on all OLED panels. The blue shift on the Pixel 2 XL isn't normal though.,YouTube
821,Please link the support article,YouTube
822,are u going to da a giveaway with the iPhone x?,YouTube
823,"to me, i didn't see nothing wrong with the pixel and apple screen, look perfectly fine to me",YouTube
824,Really? Are we still discussing blue shift?? ... ...,YouTube
825,I ve noticed flashing lights comming from faceid sensores and it is so disturbing. Is it noticable at real or just on cammera because this can be dealbreaker?,YouTube
826,Is this video demonitized?,YouTube
827,I think that my s7 edge has a better display than both of these beasts. ??,YouTube
828,"It should cost 2,000 usd please Apple",YouTube
829,so many gestures to learn and remember.. and people said iphone is simple and easy.. lol,YouTube
830,Thank you Jeff! The silver color is my favorite.,YouTube
831,"No one noticed about “Made in China, and FCC info” on the back of the phone!",YouTube
832,Samsung>Lg that’s all,YouTube
833,"If you are going to measure the displays, you need to quantify the blue shift in order to have an ounce of credibility. If you can't do that then don't make a video. Your video is subjective and I know I have excellent vision because of what I do for a living. You have to account for your vision acuity for detecting blue shift.",YouTube
834,I thought t mobile was going to be the sponsor...lol,YouTube
835,"My pixel 2xl hasn't shipped out yet, but I already hands-on demo at  store. I have to see the blue tint is very visible. I don't think Google could fix it by software. I don't know what should I do ? cancle my pre-order ? get a iPhone X ?",YouTube
836,"Super interested in the X. I love my pixel 2 XL, but I might pick up an X as a second phone. Will see!",YouTube
837,the notch kills battery percentage ?,YouTube
838,Nice video Jeff. Damn i never thought Pixel 2 XL display was that blue,YouTube
839,I have an S8+ and my screen I believe has zero blue shift. Correct me if I'm wrong but I feel it's just not up to Samsung's quality of screen tech.,YouTube
840,The Pixel 2 display is cool,YouTube
841,its a samsung display  its perfectly fine only thing thats noticeable is its not as thin as the note 8 screen you can tel there is a space between the gass and the screen itself,YouTube
842,So many iPhone X notifications I’ve got so I first start with Jeff and then Tim Scofield,YouTube
843,I've only watched 2 other unboxing and initial reviews today. You have your dedicated community. Great video as usual.,YouTube
844,"If the phone was purchased from AT&T, I think it's locked, if you paid retail price then you have to wait and I think request it.. If you bought it directly from Apple and it's the att version, then it's unlocked. At least, when I worked at att, a few years ago..",YouTube
845,It’s cos the pixel fucking sucks,YouTube
846,rather. have iphone x than ugly pixel 2 xl,YouTube
847,"After taking my iPhone X to Apple they told me it’s the first time they’ve seen this manufacture issue and it could very well effect the Water resistance, so they will be replacing my iPhone X free of charge for a brand new one, but I do have to wait a few days because there’s none in stock.",YouTube
848,I'd expect to get a new one from the apple store straight away!!,YouTube
849,Get a replacement man besides 14 days ain’t gone,YouTube
850,iPhone X commercial “You are my best friend and we got some things to do....”  Me “Yeah fix my fucking $1000 iPhone” (Changes made because people are emotionally disturbed),YouTube
851,Can you give this comment a heart ?,YouTube
852,Damn. Thanks for the heads up bro. Waiting to get mine but will keep an out our for it ??,YouTube
853,I changed the topic of this comment for it to not make sense:),YouTube

856,"Dude i ike ur vids but cmon, this isn't a ""real"" problem",YouTube
857,Bro i want to give you process of getting iphone x live wallpaper on iphone 6s,YouTube
858,The most expensive phone shouldn't have this kind of defect.,YouTube
859,Clearly you drop or hit it...,YouTube
860,Not a premium product for a premium price.  Lots more issues.  Another day another problem.  Touch screen acutally feezes when you set outside in cold weather.  Give it like 2 seconds to warm up?  Screen burn potential issues and buggy software.,YouTube
861,Love your channel,YouTube
862,My speaker is crackling/popping at higher volume especially on video? I saw on the forums people are having similar issues. Have you noticed anything? Taking mine back for a replacement tomorrow,YouTube

874,No way would I spend £1000 on this piece of junk.,YouTube
875,hi,YouTube
876,What do you expect with garbage,YouTube
877,First,YouTube
878,"My insurance company sent me an iPhone 8 Plus where, upon unboxing, I noticed the top of the front wasn’t flush with the metal band. Also if you pressed the top of the phone, it made a crunch sound. Also the water… anyways I went to Apple and they gave me a new phone on the spot.",YouTube
879,I had the same problem.,YouTube
880,Um why my left corner display of my iPhone X seems pop up some?,YouTube
881,"Brand new phone: True Depth camera doesn't work.  Probably exchange it for an iPhone 7, tomorrow.  Buzz kill.  Policy:  I never give anything/anyone a second chance when it's a bad first impression.",YouTube
882,My phone force quits all the time. Goes out of apps. Hangs up face time calls. Over heats really fast after little bit of use. Do I have a defect phone?,YouTube
883,"Who cares? You’re not that important, man. Just get a replacement and done.",YouTube
884,no no is not there. here let me show you....  flip the front side up. look at the top near the earpiece. did you see a black patch? the so called notch? yea that one. it block off a part of your screen. better get it fixed,YouTube
885,"I just got mine today, after 2 hours it's completely stopped working, screen locked and I have to take it to Apple by tomorrow. It's horrible coz when you pay 1000£, you don't expect this big problem",YouTube
886,"It used to be Samsung who had defects in their phones and Apple was the high-quality option. Now, Simpson has a higher quality and Apple has lots of defects. It is amazing that in the 6 years After Steve Jobs death that Apple became what Steve Jobs sought to destroy and avoid at all costs.",YouTube
887,"give us more than two seconds to look at it, and maybe from more than one angle...",YouTube
888,"Apple call it ""Innovation"" it is normal ;-) Just like the green line issue it is innovation....",YouTube
889,1200 euro in Italia... I prefer Galaxy S8 because of the price. Apple = I have much much more MONEY than you but i still need and want your MONEY.,YouTube
890,iPhone x is very very very best smartphone but I am miss the button,YouTube
891,pls kick off the designer for this i phone x its so stupid,YouTube
892,What is that light blinking on the front facing camera,YouTube
893,My s7's volume button has the same thing.,YouTube
894,"Whenever Apple comes out with something new or a completely new design phone. I always skip it and wait till the next one after that. Iphone 4= Antenna Problems. Iphone 5=feel outdated and incomplete. Iphone 6 plus= Bendgate. That's why I am rocking my Iphone 7 plus right now. Yes, don't get me wrong The Iphone x is an amazing phone. But I would wait for the Iphone 11 or something next year. They probably will come out something like this but with all the improvements and such.",YouTube
895,Well what do you expect from a Chinese device?,YouTube
896,iCrap,YouTube
897,I'll gladly take it off your hands,YouTube
898,"i read ""Masturbating"" ????",YouTube
899,From the looks of everything this crap is having a hard launch,YouTube
900,"just got mine a few hours ago, no issues!",YouTube
901,Just noticed mine tilts too.  Mine is not stiff  though.  I bought 2 have not checked the other (I’m out of town). I have no Apple Store near me...ordered through our carrier (Verizon). Thanks,YouTube
902,For 1000 bucks it better be flawless,YouTube
903,ANY ISSUE ON A PHONE THATS 800+ Dollers especially 1000+ dollers IS NOT A MINOR ISSUE ITS MAJOR!!! If you are  paying that much you expect it to be perfect,YouTube
904,"that's what happens when Apple pushes their employees to work harder faster at the sweat shop to meet customer demand, you get defects, malfunctions and everything in between.",YouTube
905,Why so many defects???,YouTube
906,all iPhone have problems ..their all crap you couldn't pay me to use Apple maybe they should fix the crap phones that have out before they make a new model,YouTube
907,That notch........OMG.....,YouTube
908,Now lick your finger for losing $1000,YouTube
909,That ugly camera bump though.,YouTube

913,I got the cut of the “green line” and the screen tends to be green too  Check on my insta @irz.kaizer,YouTube
914,I noticed the same problem on like half of the iPhone X's that I looked at in the stores.,YouTube
915,Well here's your first issue... Apple,YouTube
916,The Iphone 10 x or whatever  is already a Failure :/ aahahhahahhaahahahahhahhahaaahaahaaahahahahahahahhahhahaahaahaha,YouTube
917,When Apple is gonna release the new iPhone 11??,YouTube
918,eyy u swedish,YouTube
919,You did it yourself jerk why are you tying to bash Apple get a life brick,YouTube
920,"But wait, I thought Apple is always top quality, never has issues and only launch a product when it's perfect?",YouTube
921,My issue is that I eventually won‘t get my X until february ??   I refreshed the whole day until I was able to pre-order. So that sucks ?,YouTube
922,Kids in China sending suicide msgs again,YouTube

925,Why you speaking to fast ?,YouTube
926,Watching on my iPhone X ! I Don't have this problem. Yet.,YouTube
927,hello John from school,YouTube
928,hello John,YouTube
929,good morning,YouTube
930,Does Apple changed you iPhone X? I just wonder about it.,YouTube
931,The prob is Apple! They are the worst company ever,YouTube
932,Damn the iPhone 8 came fucked up now a few problems with the X I love my galaxy's iPhones are really nice but Samsung came a long way try em out sometime,YouTube
933,That’s very poor for costly mobile phone for any company! Could it be related to the expanded battery issue?!,YouTube
934,"Mine kind of has the same issue, but it's a lot less tilted comparing with yours. Seems like I should go to Apple Store too",YouTube
935,MUTE GATE,YouTube
936,I got mine delivered with adhesive glue left behind between the screen and the case and also small cracks in the stainless steel. The phone crashed later that day and wouldn’t turn on. Huge issues with Apple to get a replacement. I am disgusted by their treatment of customers who have invested such large sums in on of their devices.,YouTube
937,Wow Iphone X?,YouTube
938,Just give me your iPhone X,YouTube
939,Does anyone think the same that this guy actually sounds like joker played by Heath Ledger? Fking sexy,YouTube
940,Does anyone think the same that this guy actually sounds like joker played by Heath Ledger? Fking sexy,YouTube
941,Hi what is better iPhone 8 plus or note8 !!!!,YouTube
942,"?phone X  =  Kaka ,, Caca  !  ??",YouTube
943,"""You just have to get used to it"" lol",YouTube
944,I have same problem,YouTube
945,I got 16 of these and none of them had a defect. Weird,YouTube
946,"They can’t even make a $1,000 phone right. LMAO",YouTube
947,First! Keep it up man! ?,YouTube
948,Those benchmarks scores on the iPhone 8 and 10 will not be noticed in day to day usage.  The RAM management is not that great because Apps are having to reload often.,YouTube
949,The biggest issue with this phone is the ridiculous price and all the extra expenses that Apple forces you to go through.,YouTube
950,"Good review!   My wife has the iPhone X, and she says that her battery life is horrible if she uses it.  Standby is good.  She also said that her phone is very, very laggy, more lag than her 7 that she had.  She has had to restart phone at least twice a day, and she has the 256 GB variant.  She thought it was just her phone, but apparently not.  She also mentioned a few things that you mentioned, like the annoying notch, the constant restarting of apps, and the stainless steel sides on hers are really scratched up, and she has a UAG case on hers.  She was going to take the phone back to the store and switch it up with the 8 plus, as a phone that is $1200 out the door, it runs like an old school HTC Evo.",YouTube
951,Never buy a product one day because you are a beta tester. You are not a Android fanboy you love tech.,YouTube
952,"I keep hearing that apps aren't optimized yet for iPhone X, but I've never ever heard anyone ever say that about the hundreds or thousands of Android devices.  I always would just hear oh, android isn't as optimized as ios.  This really makes me appreciate the fact that Android developers have to optimize their app for an absurd amount of devices sizes, SOC, functionality, etc... where ios has only a hand full of designs and all of a sudden, oh its not optimized yet..",YouTube
953,YOU'LL GET USED TO IT ... The catch phrase for the iPhone X lol,YouTube
954,They should have given the option by building the fingerprint scanner into the power button...,YouTube
955,"You’re crazy! The glass back , i think, feels extremely grippy and not slippery at all. I really like the glass back.",YouTube
956,You look high :D,YouTube
957,"a normal user will not load 15 to 20 apps at the same time like you, regardless of what you say iphone X will be on top for a while. a normal consumer will be satisfied with iphone and he will buy it over and over again.",YouTube
958,The Note 8 has 6GB of RAM and smokes this iphone,YouTube
959,You said it has the A9 bionic chip but it have the A11 bionic chip,YouTube
960,They should've made the notch a little smaller. Like the essential phone.,YouTube
961,To close apps hold the app till it turns red then swipe up they will delete,YouTube
962,Refresh every time you open apps because you closed the background refresh in the setting.,YouTube
963,"When you said you were an android fanboy at heart and the that you really had a lot of fun with the Animoji's, I stopped watching. Why did you even make this video? It makes no sense.",YouTube
964,It is A11 Bionic chip man not A9 bionic,YouTube
965,"The iPhone X is still new, I give the phone 2 months and it will be amazing lol (sad we have to wait for updates but what can we do)",YouTube
966,"There are always going to be bugs and a learning curve with a design change. If you are an early adopter then you are a beta tester. That’s why I upgraded to the iPhone 8. I use my phone for work and can not afford issues so I will wait. The same with the s8, first bezel less Galaxy, and that was a poor buy. This review doesn’t take that into account which is no surprise from a self-confessed hardcore Android fan. The s8 RAM management was atrocious and I don’t remember this reviewer giving his beloved Samsung a hard time. Just go back to your Note and be happy.",YouTube
967,You can swipe them away once you hold down. You don’t have to hit the little red button. Apps aren’t caught up yet that’s all,YouTube
968,"I disagree with your op .wrt build- quality. It is, in my OP, the most beautiful build I've seen in years. ? I wish Samsung would do Stainless steel on the sides. Just my take.",YouTube
969,No church today or did you just have time to change clothes? ?,YouTube
970,Your two cents mean nothing! Keep using the Android that you are used to. Stop complaining dude.,YouTube
971,I've had NONE of these problems this guy mentions. My phones been perfect,YouTube
972,You can swipe the apps away when you hold them down until the red button comes up just swipe up and they will exit out,YouTube
973,Aren't background apps killed after awhile to save battery life? Of course you have to reload the app later on in the day,YouTube
974,"If you don't like iPhone why not give away? I always feel like to ask people who review iPhone (or any other phone) negatively. I believe many people would love to have your phone. Just ask for help, we can help you to get rid of it .. anyway you have done your review videos ..",YouTube
975,First major problem is the logo on the back or is that a camera bump unsure.,YouTube
976,"I know exactly how that feels with everything is one more step to do sth so simple. If a million things that require you to do one more step, then it is a million time more steps. The A11 chip is fast, but the overall experience is making it feels slow. It is just like a 800 bhp super car with a 20 speed gear box. The gear changing is just gonna be inconvenient. Human is the one that can't finish the extra step fast enough.",YouTube
977,"Tell the truth & shame the devil. Good Job! Apple X is not all that just like all the other iPhones. No comparison to Android. OS fans are like Trump supporters....they will never admit their crap. This phone is $1000+?! There are plenty of $500-$700 Androids that do what the iPhone X can do and more. It took them how many years to do wireless charging? Oh yeah, Apple does feature NFC on the X though...No Field Communication ha! Apple will add NFC  when they put out the red X for all the iSheep. They will charge another $200 more for that one. You have to buy your own quick charge brick too. Make sure you have iWatch on because Oops...no always on display either.",YouTube
978,Hold and swipe in 1 time to close apps without using the minus sign,YouTube
979,You knock the iPhone X for switching to the glass back but you said you love the wireless charging that the glass back allowed it to have. So would you rather have wireless charging or a metal back? I actually find the new glass back less slippery than the metal back of last year. Also my s7 in my opinion is just as slippery,YouTube
980,Can't u swipe the apps away once you hold down on one?,YouTube
981,You can swipe apps away once you hold down dude.,YouTube
982,"Great job. What’s your daily driver?  Have the X on order. I tried note 8 and pixel 2 XL, both Good phones with their own issues.  Your review makes me a little worried about the X ?",YouTube
983,Mute point???? It’s “Moot Point” like an issue open for debate or an issue of no value because it’s hypothetical.,YouTube
984,I can't use my headphones while charging my phone... Wtf... Please samsung don't remove the headphone jack,YouTube
985,Moot point. Not mute point.,YouTube
986,Sometimes I like to curl up in a corner and pretend I am a potato,YouTube
987,You can swipe apps away. When you hold down the app and you get the delete button you can then swipe the app away. I wonder how long developers will take to optimize apps for this phone.,YouTube
988,I’m getting this phone based on the positive review this channel gave me. ?,YouTube
989,Iphone X sucks,YouTube
990,This is the first bad iPhone X review I’ve seen so far. Go back to your shitdroid phones... I don’t agree with u on anything in this video,YouTube
991,A9 or A11 ?,YouTube
992,Trash review,YouTube
993,"Iris scanner on Note 8/S8/S8+ is very fast and works perfectly on total dark, why always talk about face recognitions ? Because apple use it we must use it ?",YouTube
994,I totally get why people would like the metal back over glass. But as always compromises have to be made for other features. The thing I really dont get is the large price tag if you want to charge the iphone X faster.,YouTube
995,Team #note8!,YouTube
996,Your face look like Samsung just use Samsung plastic company,YouTube
997,"Dude you can swipe the apps away, non necessarily close them with the x bottom",YouTube
998,4:43 BURN,YouTube

1000,You are just a big bag of wind.,YouTube
1001,My iphone x have problem with charging,YouTube
1002,iphone x have problem with charging,YouTube
1003,"Carriers are offering two for one deals so the phone is really valued now at $500. Stop the $1, 000s nonsense has lost 50% of its value after launch.",YouTube
1004,Yes you can just swipe up on the application to close it after you get the option to close them,YouTube
1005,"The metal feels like plastic, what a doughbag??? I didn’t experience any of his problems clearly an android guy as he stated",YouTube
1006,Is easy for you to say since you are android fan.  But spot on!,YouTube
1007,My Note 8. I unplug at 5 am get home it's at around 50-60% depending on use!! Crazy the lack of battery life with this iphone.,YouTube
1008,A9 bionic chip???? You meant A11 bionic chip,YouTube
1009,Did anyone else notice he said A9 Bionic chip at 3:45,YouTube
1010,Lol it's an iPhone.. nothing ever changes,YouTube
1011,Waste of time slick wraps cover the whole fucking phone while your at it,YouTube
1012,Embrace the change stop complaint.  I agree about the price,YouTube
1013,"I’m getting annoyed with people just bashing the iPhoneX when there problems are easily fixed. You said you have to stop listening to music and then charge you’re phone........ WTF the iPhoneX has a wireless charging! Carry on listening to you’re music and drop the phone on a wireless charger sorted. We all know how much they cost is that really a big deal compared to the iPhone8+? NO that phone was £800, its not like we have gone from an £400 iPhone to bam a £1000. Get over it apple have great aftercare service so you’re paying for a service not just a device. Rant over or shall i carry on.............?",YouTube
1014,bella,YouTube
1015,"It's a moot point, not mute. Love your videos and perspective. ?",YouTube
1016,A lot of good points here. It's why I went with the 8 plus.,YouTube
1017,What the Galaxy note 8 iris and face scanner work in *PITCH DARKNESS* for me!,YouTube
1018,I’ve had the phone 5 days and honestly it’s fucking awesome bro! Best thing I’ve ever bought!,YouTube
1019,"iPhone 10 haircut. Yeah, the iPhone 10 is disappointing. If it weren't for the notch but the $1,000 price is not worth it.",YouTube
1020,Seems like you complaining about iOS not the actual IPhone.,YouTube
1021,Bro i have lg g3 d855 i install twrp when i press power+volume down and go to factory reset than message appeared fastboot mode started than tmit struck,YouTube
1022,Ofcorse you can swipe up to close apps once you hold them and get the - mark.,YouTube
1023,I have an iPhone X since the first week. I can count on my hands how many times Face ID didn’t work or recognize my face. You should also actually use this phone for a couple weeks before you review it. A lot of your points are just wrong. If you wanna love on Android so much than just make Android videos.,YouTube
1024,You can still swipe apps away after holding them you don’t have to use the x button,YouTube
1025,That is why note 8 is best,YouTube
1026,When do you think there’ll optimize apps like YouTube and twitch for the galaxy s8 plus? I understand for YouTube you can pinch to zoom but it cuts a little bit of the video. Otherwise if I want to watch it in full screen showing the whole video the black bars will appear on the side. When will they optimize it so that way I can watch it full screen without it cutting half the video? It’s doing the same with twitch. Sure. Apps like Facebook and Instagram and twitter optimized it. Why not YouTube and twitch?,YouTube
1027,"Okay so I’m not an iPhone guy, I just switched back to my iPhone 6 a couple weeks ago because my n6p has battery issues, but if you only got 50% success rate on Face ID, you clearly didn’t set it up properly, and you said why would Apple make it a bezel-less screen if apps aren’t optimised, this is most definitely a step in the right direction even if it’s not perfect, you gave this phone an unfair description",YouTube
1028,"You make me sick,all phones has there issues however all phones have there problems,I still conclude Apple is still the best",YouTube
1029,"On android phones  We(consumer)give suggestions and you(company) pls adjust it at the next update or phone. On Iphone  We(company)give it like this, adjust to what we have given to you(consumer).",YouTube

1039,That’s why I got the iPhone 8 Plus instead I knew the iPhone X would be crap and I knew the iPhone 11 would fix it all so I waited it’s not like I sacrificed any specs they have the same specs as the 8,YouTube
1040,Seriously is a piece of crap I’ve been using iPhone for five years and I am moving to the note 8 I can’t wait I had it with iPhones,YouTube
1041,I like the iPhone X but I’ve been having issues charging it when not at home that i never had a problem with on my 7 Plus and the phone seems to make my phone calls through my Bluetooth a bit choppy. My 14 day return is up this Friday and I’m to the point where I’m tired of going to the Apple store and am just going to probably return it for the Note 8,YouTube

1046,"The biggest flaws of any phone, is the fools who buy them.  All the flagships have been rushed to production giving different angles on the same tech to fool people into buying garbage.  Booo, people wake the hell up, it seems tech stops in the 2000, looks like that was the bug they were worried about.",YouTube
1047,"1. Bezeless?? It looks chunky af! This is comparing to other new devices though such as Xiaomi, Samsung and LG. Not the most appealing design in any way.  2. That god damn camera bump is cancer. Basically the same as the Note 8 apart from the flash, and there's no bump at all.  3. Missing USB C, 3.5mm jack, and Expandable storage - common place in smart phones. They charge $999 USD (AND IN AUSTRALIA IT'LL BE NEARING $2'000!!!!) for something missing everyday features? Pass.  4. Stainless steel sides you say? Prepare for inevitably large amounts of scratches...  5. Fingerprint sensors. You can unlock your phone before looking at it while pulling it out of your pocket! I say THAT is the future apple. Not Face ID. Hipsters.  6. Gestures, gestures, gestures. I have nothing against gestures, but if you need to use 3 different swipes IN REPLACEMENT of tapping a button? That seems like a huge step back.   7. The ""dot projection"" thing with animojis is the MOST gimmicky thing I've ever heard. The tech is very impressive, but could be used better.  8. Resolution. We live in a world of QHD smart phones ok? Catch up.  9. IP67 water resistant. For the price you'd be wanting only 68 or higher imo.  10. Half the brightness of the Note 8? Seemings they're using Samsung's screens it seems they've gotten the throw outs lmao.  Decent parts - What is good is the 1080p 240fps video, and 4k 60fps. However good luck saving those files without expandable memory. The processor is only 6 cores, and it allegedly only has 3 or 4GB of RAM.... however the neural element is pretty cool I guess.  Portrait mode lighting seems also a bit gimmicky but it's there if you want it for some reason.  HDR10 and Dolby Vision. Samsung's new devices support this so it's nothing new, but it's admirable.  Better battery should be good, but wish they weren't so shady about it. Don't see why they need to be?  Speakers seems like they'll be pretty great. 25% louder than the 7, and more bass. That's definitely Samsung's downfall.  Incase you were wondering, I'm a Galaxy S8 plus user.",YouTube
1048,"I can think of 10 reasons why I won't be buying it  1. It's ugly!  2. Price. Seriously Apple, $999/$1149 + tax is WAY TOO DAMN HIGH for what you're getting. There are too many other good phones at similar/lower prices (S8/S8+, Note 8, G6, V30, U11, Z2 Force, OnePlus 5, etc.)  3. iOS is virtually non-customizable = boring. I have owned iPhones in the past and got bored with them quickly. I switched to Android and have been much happier since. It is just so much more customizable and I have freedom to do basically whatever I want.  4. No USB-C: (the same reason as the video)  5. No fingerprint scanner: My bank uses fingerprint sign-in, without a scanner, it would be much more difficult to log into my bank account and access my information. Also, I wear glasses/sunglasses and from my experience, the facial recognition software won't recognize you if you wear glasses/sunglasses.  6. No Iris scanner: Samsung's Iris scanner is very useful and very secure. Everyone's irises are unique so it is impossible to hack an iris scanner.  7. No headphone jack: ""No headphone jack, that's so whack"" - Flossy Carter. I will not be buying a phone without a headphone jack any time soon. I listen to music a lot and Bluetooth headphones simply don't have the battery life or the plug-and-play simplicity. I'm always left waiting a few seconds for my headphones to turn on and connect before I can start listening to my songs with Bluetooth headphones. Once they can connect more quickly and can last all day, then it makes sense to kill the headphone jack. But that time is not now.  8. No microSD expansion: Instead of being able to buy cheap microSD cards to expand storage, Apple has the balls to charge $150 more for 256GB of storage. And when that storage is full, you have to delete things instead of being able to swap cards.  9. Display: It's not a 1440p display! It only has 458 ppi, compared to the Galaxy S8's 570 ppi.  10. IT'S UGLY! Seriously, what were the Apple design team thinking when they decided that ugly cutout at the top was OK!? Even the Essential phone's ugly cutout looks better in my opinion. I personally like the look of the MI Mix 2, S8/S8+, Note 8,  G6, and V30 better than that stupid ugly cutout at the top.  Still, I'm proud of Apple for finally adding an OLED display, wireless charging, and facial recognition. They're finally giving iPhone users features that Android phones have had for years now.",YouTube
1049,Everything about it besides the processor is a disappointment but that's too be expected from Apple,YouTube

They could have taken AR and took it further than anyone else and combined it with VR but they didn't. It is just another phone and besides being in Apple ecosystem, there is no reason to get it over Note 8, V30, or most likely Pixel2.",YouTube
1052,I seriously don't understand why they wouldn't just embed a fingerprint scanner into the apple logo on the back?? Anybody know why they have never done that?,YouTube
1053,they shouldve just called it X instead of 10 because what will they do in 2 years will they just skip 10??,YouTube

1409,its why i went for the 8+,YouTube
1410,Now I feel so happy I did not waste $1200,YouTube
1411,agreed. what also sucks is laying down. it NEVER gets it.,YouTube
1412,"How does the facial recognition work in low light? Or no light? I'd imagine that would be an issue as well. To bad, that would be a deal killer for me i think and I was actually considering switching from Android to iOS for my next phone.",YouTube
1413,Or if you work in Healthcare where you are required to wear a surgical mask????? Major bummer,YouTube
1414,"Sam lit with those ski goggles, great video man",YouTube
1415,My main issue with FaceID is that it doesn’t continuously scan for your face. It scans once and done. So I end up haven’t to move the phone in some way. Other than that it works really well for me.,YouTube
1416,"If FaceID fails, just press the ""FaceID"" text shown, you will get instant to your number pad.",YouTube
1417,"I think you overlooked something, In subzero temperatures you will be wearing gloves. Guess what doesn’t work with gloves? TouchID. I’d much rather pull down a face mask than take off my gloves in that weather.",YouTube
1418,Hey Sam what about gloves and touchID? ?,YouTube
1419,"the best iphone i had was 3gs. Never had problems with faceID , man",YouTube
1420,I have the S8 overall in my opinion better than the iPhone X.,YouTube
1421,You could fight the point of Touch ID and wearing gloves. Please don’t become one of those youtubers that come up with pointless problems just to make a video.,YouTube
1422,Currently watching on the iPhone X ?,YouTube
1423,I like this video good job!!!,YouTube
1424,Going outside also means wearing gloves so touch ID is screwed too ???,YouTube
1425,True......I miss Touch ID.,YouTube
1426,"Wearing gloves is more common than covering your entire face in the cold. TouchID doesn't work with gloves on as well, and the notch is not a big deal, you'll be stuck with it in 2018 as well,  by now it's a design choice by Apple that's going to be here to stay.  I don't see TouchID coming back as well, just like the headphone jack and a plethora of ports on the Macbooks",YouTube
1427,Oh nooo ... Sam has issues using his $1300 iPhone ... Wow poor sam ... Currently watching this video on iPhone 4s (not a joke) if you are not happy with your phone send it to me ??,YouTube
1428,if you tap where it says “face id” the passcode comes up,YouTube
1429,"You wasn't really fair in the freezing temperatures scenario, because in such a scenario that you need to cover your whole head because of the temperature, you also need to use gloves, and Touch ID doesn't work with gloves, ending up basically with the same problem.  Buy yeah, Face ID is in his first generation, so there is always room for improvements to be made in the next iterations.",YouTube
1430,"FIRST THING: you don’t have to wait for the numeral password to pop up, just swipe up and press where it says “Face ID” and it’ll pop up instantly.",YouTube
1431,Touch ID > Face ID,YouTube
1432,still rocking my iphone 6 plus. lewls.,YouTube
1433,If you go to unlock your face with faceID and you know its not going to work. You can press the FaceID text in the middle of the screen. This will bring the passcode up far quicker.   Hope this helps Sam :-),YouTube
1434,"Face ID works with a wet face, but touch ID doesn’t work with wet fingers.",YouTube
1435,"Because i work as an craftman, i often wear gloves/have destroyed fingerprints. So im happy with face id, its not perfect, but i prefer it over touch id?",YouTube
1436,"I am fortunate to have this phone and I gotta say that I think the gripes about Face ID are a bit exaggerated... so a few weeks out of the year you specifically (not myself who is fine with a beanie to keep me warm) have to wait an extra two seconds for Face ID to fail. Also that isn’t an issue with the phone so much as the software so I would expect that to improve with future updates. Also it’s legit like half a second slower than Touch ID if it’s already in your hand... who cares. Lastly the notch, on the phone you compared the x to, they had no screen the bar at the top (which in essence is the notch) so on the x they give you more screen space to phone Face ratio than opposed to not having it, when viewed in the right context I don’t see how one can complain about it, especially with the OLED display which can turn off the pixels at the top completely of you are watching media.",YouTube
1437,but if you're all geared up don't you have gloves on anyway?,YouTube
1438,"I think you made a good point with saying that it isn't worth the price, but your reasons for not buying it seem silly. You should stay away from a phone if you don't like the overall OS or specs for the price, not a line on the screen and a few seconds you need to spend every time you want to use it.",YouTube
1439,Face ID works for me perfectly. Never Touch ID again.,YouTube
1440,"The only things are nitpicking, at the most 2s",YouTube
1441,Is your life seriously that important/precious that you can't spend an extra second to unlock your phone?,YouTube
1442,Sorry but I prefer Android.,YouTube
1443,Lol this video is dumb if you’re gonna wear this much of cloths then you sure gonna wear some gloves ? so there goes your touch id.,YouTube
1444,"To show the passcode just press the Face ID text when you swipe it, works for me",YouTube
1445,Face ID on my iPhone X works 70% of the time,YouTube
1446,I unlock my phone around 200 times everyday. This must be a major annoyance.,YouTube
1447,Its the iphone 10 not x. X is a Roman numeral,YouTube
1448,Loved the side by side speed comparison. Nice video Sam!,YouTube
1449,"Agreed, you can still swipe and tap the screen immediately after to show the touch pad, though.",YouTube
1450,You can bring up the keypad for your password faster by just tapping the “Face ID” text. When you tap that it will show up straight away.,YouTube
1451,What is the tripod in introo? Please reply Sam,YouTube
1452,If it is cold out wouldn’t you gave gloves so touch id would not work,YouTube
1453,So you're telling me that you don't wear gloves with this kind of weather ?,YouTube
1454,You can actually make a new scan of your face while wearing a ski helmet and goggles and use that when you ski. That's what I did the other day and it worked really well. I wish you could have multiple scans of your face though,YouTube
1455,"WTF the IR sensor is constantly scanning :/ Also, any iPhone needs to be jailbroken to get rid of annoying software quirks, otherwise iOS is frustrating, especially with the stupid transition animations.",YouTube
1456,"I've had an iPhone 5 since 2012. Loved it. Never used touch ID until recently purchasing a Moto G5 Plus. I love it. Glad I did not get an iPhone X. I'm sorry to see what looks like Apple going backwards with many of their innovations.... MagSafe, anyone?",YouTube
1457,I bought 2 for kids fir Xmas gotta have em,YouTube
1458,"Dammit, I hate it when I cant unlock my phone when I’m casually wearing a ski mask",YouTube
1459,naturally next year it will get much better im looking at this iphone x as an early adopter purchase at this point  iphone x plus will be a fire phone bigger screen fix the rear camera orientation   i dont mind the notch at all no carrier info is super awesome i love it  x plus will be amazing and i hope its 949 for the 256 no over 1000 for a phone,YouTube
1460,"Face ID has it’s shortcomings, but overall it is far better in my opinion.  Cons: In the cold: most people wear gloves before facial coverings Pros: In the car: far easier to unlock with a swipe than an awkward touch With wet/dirty fingers: a tap and look opens the notification Touch ID was good, Face ID is better.",YouTube
1461,In sub-freezing temperatures you would have your gloves on so Touch ID wouldn't work too. People just like to hate on Apple for bringing something new,YouTube
1462,Been on iPhones since the iPhone 4 but I've had enough. Samsung/Pixel it is!,YouTube
1463,"...""horns""... hahaha",YouTube
1464,But you’re wearing gloves sooooo.....,YouTube
1465,wow you have to wait an extra 2 seconds to unlock while your in full ski gear... maybe you should interact with the real world little more.,YouTube
1466,Face ID can be faster but Apple wants to give people the option to look at their notification. I am biased because Touch ID doesn’t work on my finger because I have a disorder that changes my fingerprint so Touch ID isn’t perfect but Face ID can. When Touch ID first came out it was slow so slow that people preferred the passwords but after many software updates and many improvements it became great and that’s what Face ID will become,YouTube
1467,The bar on the bottom is there for consumers who are not tech geeks like us I think Apple will give people an option in ios 12 and faze it out completely in IOS 13 like their down with the adapter I am predicting that Apple will remove the adapter completely next year,YouTube
1468,Is there a way to make it so that you just have to input a passcode and have Face ID not have your face stored?,YouTube
1469,why are u wearing woman goggles,YouTube
1470,"Uhh, we people are so amazing! Its just a less than 2 seconds delay to show the keypad and we start complaining, while we waste hours everyday watching crap in YouTube or doing other nonsense stuff, if you guys think that two seconds is a big problem, why don't you make something better than that, and if you can't, stop complaining and appreciate what others have done",YouTube
1471,"Ok Google, order an iPhone X for me",YouTube
1472,"I feel like 2017 was the year of the let down. the pixel 2 xl had a shit display the smaller pixel 2 had huge bezels the iPhone X had a notch and no Touch ID and every other smartphone I just don't care enough to invest in. Before you say Samsung, I hate tough wiz. specially when it keeps warning you that you're turning the volume up too high.  I hope 2018 is better. bring back Touch ID on the new iPhones and google, please stop fucking up on your hardware.",YouTube
1473,I totally think/hope TouchID will make a comeback once the tech to put the fingerprint sensor under the display is perfected.,YouTube
1474,Rich people problems,YouTube
1475,Epic video as always. And your going outside ski slopes ensamble looks very toasty indeed. I am irritated with the digital noise that happens when I  am filming a video with the X there is a cellular searching digital artifact noise that happens every 30 seconds or so that is impossible to remove like a digital hum. I find that annoying to the max.,YouTube
1476,Take the swipe bar off and I have no complaints. Face ID is 100% better than Touch ID in my opinion. Face ID still works while your fingers are wet or dirty and that's all I need. Touch ID has failed me much more than Face ID has.,YouTube
1477,"Wow first world problems, don't own an iPhone X, never will. But my gosh is that it it, thats all this issues you could come up with? was it even worth making a video about this pathetic minor issues (in your opinion) Please please STOP FUKN WHINGING about crap",YouTube
1478,What background is that?,YouTube
1479,Who puts on winter face gear before they put on gloves?,YouTube
1480,"*complains that Face ID doesn’t work when it’s cold because you have to wear a mask  *says that Touch ID was better  *doesn’t talk about the fact that when it’s cold you have to wear gloves, and Touch ID won’t work there either",YouTube
1481,"I get what he means, but I have an iPhone X and the other day I was on a mountain bike ride, wearing a full face helmet and dark glasses, and for whatever crazy reason, Face ID was still somehow able to work",YouTube
1482,When you realize a Galaxy note 8 has facial recognition... Iris scanning... Fingerprint sensor... And a passcode that you can type as it's scanning your Iris/face. Did I mention a headphone jack?,YouTube
1483,in my country it costs upto 1500$ USD,YouTube
1484,That oled agree is amazing .... I hate life,YouTube
1485,"Same as you have to take your mask off in winter to scan your face, you would have to take off your gloves to scan your finger.",YouTube

1498,"Unless you really want that 4k 60fps camera performance nothing else justifies the ridiculous price of this phone. There's better point and shoot cameras on Android (e.g. Note 8, S8, U11, Pixel 2, V30, Mate 10 etc) that takes better pictures for less money than this and some offer fp scanners, headphone jacks, excellent audio ( HTC U11, LG V30) better IP 68 ratings, SD cards, better screens and the most important feature... Less money out your pocket for things that actually matter ?",YouTube
1499,A generation where we are upset that Face ID requires an extra second to show the password as opposed to touch ID.,YouTube

1502,With you on that it needs the TouchID on the back.... roll on Summer hey?,YouTube
1503,And you don’t use gloves while skiing... the comparison between faceid and Touch ID doesn’t make sense st all. There are certain situations where touchid fail even more....,YouTube

The face Id unlocks but does not open the phone you have to slide up so I am very disappointed within my first days of this phone. I switch from galaxy family to iPhone and not very impressed,YouTube
1517,"Yeah, like the iPhone zombies would ever admit there's a problem with their beloved phone! They just deal with it! It would be like a Note 7 fanboy saying my pants are on fire because im so effing hot! And that caused my phone to burn!! Just think, in 12 months you can spend another 1k to get the iPhone XI featuring the new built in paperweight feature. So, start saving!",YouTube
1518,"Love my iPhone X, but I think it needs more ram, better IOS optimisation and a Touch ID under the screen or on the power button.",YouTube
1519,"terrible performance from iphone. ad it for 2 days, tons of issues!",YouTube
1520,"Lots of hardware, software and design issues.",YouTube
1521,Face ID annoys me honestly. Its frustrating when I’m clearly in view but it refuses to unlock. Especially if I’m laying down and decide to get on my phone. Most times it forces me to either sit up or I give in and put in my pin after the third attempt.,YouTube
1522,"i think most of the face id problems can be fixed with an software update. problems with angles cant be fixed with an update ofc, but for me face id works pretty good. its fast and recognize me 99% of the time. touch id was faster, but face id is good, also. its not as fast as touch id, but its okay for me. the display is the biggest point for me...",YouTube
1523,Because only 1k subscribers,YouTube
1524,"False, I haven’t had any issues using Face ID in any lighting conditions. In fact it seems to have gotten more responsive the more I’ve used it. Not saying that some folks couldn’t have issues, but for the majority of folks I know with the phone, they haven’t complained about those issues the reporters mentioned. Usually CNET and The Verge praise apple products, I guess they didn’t pay the both of them off this year lol.",YouTube
1525,"Face ID has WORKED FLAWLESSLY for me. Saying that a Camera can’t make out a picture when shot into direct sunlight is the most absurd argument I have ever heard.   I saw the CNET review and it was ludicrous to consider that an issue. Try pointing your camera, and I mean any camera into the sun and see what kind of photographing get. It’s called exposure and extreme lighting into any camera lens will cause a failed capture.   That’s like saying the iPhone sucks because glass breaks when you drop it.",YouTube
1526,Only it is emoji machine,YouTube
1527,mine has had problems. sometimes it dosent read my face and i have to turn off the screen and wake it up again a 2nd time for it to work,YouTube
1528,Our company did UX audit and our unit is constantly losing FaceID data after few hours. It requires hard reset (power down) otherwise FaceID setup process is locking on unfocused frame with message to readjust cam-view (lower it or change distance). I already spoke with engineers from Apple and they want to evaluate the issue. Again .. maybe its just one unit but after some graphic issues 2 months ago with two weeks old 2017 MBP I don't have much confidence in Apple's QA team anymore. At this price level failure rate should be much lower.,YouTube
1529,I’m still on iPhone 4,YouTube
1530,Watching on my X. I’ve had ZERO problems with my Face ID. Reads my face every time. In pitch dark(with brightness all the way down) and from extreme angles. I fucking love this phone.,YouTube
1531,"I’m getting mine next week, but I’ll be fine, it’s not like I even go outside? ?",YouTube
1532,ive seen like 20 vids but it is all ok,YouTube

1535,In the speed test you didn't take into account that your 10 was downloading apps.,YouTube
1536,u compare an iphone x which downloads plenty of apps in the backround with an iphone 7 plus? wait till your iphone x is set up completly.,YouTube
1537,You can change the Face ID so it doesn’t require attention mate,YouTube
1538,Turn off the TrueTone in the display settings and it will be as bright as your other iPhone :),YouTube
1539,Still worse than the galaxy s8,YouTube
1540,The best HONEST review. Thank you. You are a honest person and that very important thing. ??? ???? ??? ????. ???? ??????????. ?????? ??? ????. ?????? ???? ??????. ???? ??? ???. ????? ?????? ??? ???. ???? ????.,YouTube
1541,iPhone X was slow because all the apps were opening first time on it...and tons were downloading..,YouTube
1542,My brightness gets brighter all the way up the slider. Your new phone is indexing all your stuff which would slow it down. You aren't being fair with the test. Wait until your new one is done indexing to do the test.,YouTube
1543,Thank you for the video and you are right about the screen but if Apple paid more for the display then they would have to call their new phone a 1000 Plus.,YouTube
1544,My first impression is the Notch.       As well as my last impression.,YouTube
1545,Dude your house is amazing,YouTube
1546,So whats the major issue?,YouTube
1547,"The brightnes is jusr because it safe gaurding your phone, since tou just set it up its downloading a milion apps and stuff which is heating up the cpu the brightness and sometimes the flash light are dimmed as to not allow it to overheat",YouTube

1642,who waiting the for s9 ?????  I have s7 edge,YouTube
1643,I've ordered the S8+ the only complaint is I wish the ram would have been six instead of 4 but I going to love it anyway,YouTube
1644,i dont see these as problems at all,YouTube
1645,Nothing is perfect!!!...and the price is not too high as the Apple phones! S8 is better than any phone in the market currently!,YouTube

1655,LG G6 is the better phone...,YouTube

1660,I do think battery should been at least 3500 or 4000 going down to 3000.,YouTube

1667,I can't wait for mine to come in. It's on the way. ?,YouTube
1668,Come on now. The finger print scanner placement SUCKS!!! It's in the WORSE place you could eeeeeeeever put on a phone. And with all the sensors always on it kills the small battery even quicker. S7 edge 3600 mah down to 3000 S8 mah is a giant step backwards. I found that my G6 (3300 mah) battery faired better. Great video bro as always ???? just sharing my opinion in a couple areas concerning the S8,YouTube
1669,Nothing is Perfect Bro in the future Nothing will bring us Perfect but Everytime something better than another one However S8 is Great and Beautiful Phone in 2017!,YouTube

1673,Droid mother X  the problem I have is when a person call u and u put the ?? while u talking to them it's not loud how can I make that part happened Instead of putting it here peace inside your ear just to talk to now I'm trying to figure out how to when you put the phone to your ear and why you talking to now you can't quite hear them what they say please do tell me ASAP if u know thanks ?????,YouTube
1674,theres no such thing as a perfecr phone.,YouTube
1675,All is perfect on S8!!!!!!!,YouTube
1676,the problem with Samsung phones they are whack as fuck i got a s7 edge at it keeps stalling.stick to apple people i learnt  a lesson the hard way would never buy a Samsung phone,YouTube
1677,I still feel like the removable battery and it being waterproof would always be more logical. Trying to find a place to recharge or having to carry a large clunkey external charger is just rediclous compaired to a few thin batteries you may not have to replace and are still are able to recharge the phone.,YouTube
1678,"More "" TechN9ne  "" $$",YouTube
1679,no one or anything is perfect,YouTube
1680,SAMSUNG IS THE PEAST,YouTube
1681,I find the things that people are complaining about are ridiculous. I upgraded from the S5 to the S8 and I have 0 complaints about it.,YouTube
1682,My 2nd problem is the text keyboard the ???? every word u say don't come out right and fast like the s7eage does u reallyreally  needsto try it out pls and giveme some feed back on that  Y should I have to change the keyboard for a $850.00 phone That SUCKS to me  Samsung needs to test put there phonesbefore putting put on the market just my opinion  just like the new Xbox does if I Am going to put out a good phone iam going to make Sure it's working perfectly  4real ????????????,YouTube

1692,"All what you said .. reasons I will not buy S8 or N8 or I guess any next Samsung. I can accept compromises, but not for extra money.",YouTube
1693,Newsflash: Nothings perfect.,YouTube
1694,"More seriously, colleague and I had a sound issue. similar to the issue the S7 has.  Sound just cuts out intermittently.  Fades in and out every other second or just stops.   There are various solutions around the web but none actually worked. Colleague got a refund and I was just packing mine to take it back. Removed the SD card and took it out of the Samsung live LED case. Started working normally when I did this.   No good to me as I cant rely on it so I will still get a refund as its not reliable but one or the other or both of those things seemed to do the trick.  Factory reset, different players, nothing else seemed to make a difference.  Tried the S7 solution (developer mode and turn off USB sound switching).  Nothing else worked.  No idea if this is just misleading and the issue will come back because the fault tends to be intermittent anyway.  But it been playing an audiobook for an hour which is the longest so far.",YouTube
1695,Samsung is having sound problems! ???,YouTube
1696,nothing is perfect..haters always hate,YouTube
1697,.. yep .. the battery capacity is quite smaller than my S7 Edge .. think I'll be sitting this one out and I'm going all in on the Samsung Note 8 this fall ????,YouTube
1698,"My personal top 5 problems:  1. The fact that the home button is now a software button makes me often press it by accident when I mean to press the spacebar when typing  2. Fingerprint placement is shit, obviously  3. USB C plug is a REALLY tight fit. Feels like I'm gonna throw my phone across the room just trying to get it off the charger  4. Unique aspect ratio creates relatively annoying black bars when using certain unoptimized apps (surprisingly not much of an annoyance when watching videos though)   5. Lack of improvements in the battery and camera department, and although the phone is faster, it isn't a ton faster. Hardware is relatively unchanged from last year.   And of course if you have a red tinted screen then that's quite a problem too.  Overall: I don't love it, but I like it. I recommend it personally, but you aren't crazy if you elect to pick up a Galaxy S7 as your new phone either. ",YouTube
1699,I don't know why people have problems with the fingerprint scanner bruhhh I put my finger on the edge of the right side on the back then just slide it back until I touch something and that's the fingerprint and plus sometimes I don't even do that and my muscles already go to the correct place,YouTube
1700,good video...but S8 camera is the best(I've got S8 and 7+)....and also LG G6 is sucks,YouTube
1701,"The only problem i have on s8 is fingerprint scanner , & Bixby",YouTube
1702,this have to be the dumbest   problems i have ever seen,YouTube
1703,"This is how you know Samsung is the best. Because the galaxy is the only series that comes out where everyone expects the phone to be perfect. when HTC, LG, pixel, Sony, any other android manufacturer or even the iPhone comes out, no one complains about them being perfect.  But when the galaxy comes out, people complain about it ""Not  being perfect""",YouTube
1704,This phone is extremely vulnerable to breakage. The only case  that offers good protection is a folio style case.,YouTube
1705,Love to have this beast in my hand...!!! cant wait to have s8+,YouTube
1706,Since I bought my s8 I keep getting notifications sounds without actually having received any!! I turned Notifications reminder OFF but still there!!,YouTube
1707,Can't believe people can't be enough with that phone like common billions of people don't have Any food :(,YouTube
1708,"I wish Samsung will make a NON-EDGE version of every flagship models they produce. because not all Samsung users like the edge. Like me.. I prefer the S7 than S7 edge. Because there is less display or panel or screen protection from accidental drops. And there is no case or tempered glass or screen protector available to protect the display. Anyway, the features of EDGE can be added on non edge screen.",YouTube
1709,"I have no complaints. Blows the G6 away. I'll wait for some weeklong owner reviews (you'll do one, I'm sure :). Anyway, the Note 8 might be worth the wait because this phone is so good.",YouTube
1710,"shitty phone S8, like S7 lot of problems.",YouTube
1711,But the note 8 is better ?,YouTube
1712,"apple and Samsung are trash and have been for a while. iPhones are made cheap now and Samsung lags and glitches. you can buy way better phones.. Blu $140.00 on amazon. octacore snapdragon,4g ram,4,000mah battery,6""display at 1080p, blows S8 and iPhone away! the S8 lags when multitasking or playing the best games, yes the battery is shit after 3 weeks kiss it goodbye and throw away more money for another battery. the camera is fuzzy and doesn't autofocus well.",YouTube
1713,"my issue is the finger print location, battery too small even the s7 edge battery  is bigger and ram",YouTube
1714,"You are not getting dislikes because of ""bad things"" of S8, it is because you are too biased. You keep mentioning your personal preferences instead of GIVING reasons why those complains exist. For example, you say S7 had the best camera in the market. What the heck? No... iPhone 7 has better low light and true-to life colours, better zoom and image processing. BEST 4K video. This is not my opinion. this is a fact based upon tests on youtube. The best HDR goes to Pixel (or XL). This has also been confirmed by several tests. There is no ""BEST camera"" phone.",YouTube
1715,Bla bla bla,YouTube
1716,Shake the phone to fix camera blur.. pos that no reviewer mentions,YouTube
1717,samsung s8 in my country very expensive to buy?,YouTube
1718,This phone sucks had it for 2 months now n can't upload pics on Facebook I had the same problem when I had the S4 bummer,YouTube
1719,I thought that too about the finger print sensor but i was wrong I always touch the camera,YouTube
1720,The Galaxy S8 is a terrible phone.  Apple iPhones are superior devices in EVERY way!,YouTube
1721,"The phone I had prior to this phone was a Nexus 5X which is probably considered a utilitarian and quite outdated phone.  Considering this should have been a huge upgrade, even though I didn't want a new phone (I water damaged my Nexus and needed an immediate replacement), I can say this phone isn't at all as great as I thought it should be.  It doesn't seem all that much faster.  The Bixby thing bothers me, accidently pressing that button or swiping into it.  Maybe Bixby is some great feature that people use, but I'm not interested in it, and even after disabling it, it still gets in the way and the process is running.  Apps seem to crash all the time, even with the latest updates for the phone.  One app that constantly crashes is Google Maps.  There are others but I won't list them, there are a lot.  Though I will be getting a case, the phone has a super low coefficient of friction.  It slides off my lap in the car, slides all over the seat, ... given the chance or slight nudge of momentum this phone will move around a lot.  While being comfortable to hold, it is by far the easiest phone to drop I've ever had.  I never had to restart my Nexus on a daily basis to get things to work right.  I have to restart this phone daily to make things operate correctly.  Now, my phone is a from T-mobile.  Perhaps if I had the chance to buy the phone on its own without a contract so the phone didn't have all the T-Mobile bloatware, it may be a different story.  I needed a phone right away, so I got this from my provider.  Anyway, it just doesn't seem to be that great.  Samsung seems to have a lot of proprietary programming on the OS.  The nexus was just a cut and dry straight up android phone.  This, not so much.  Just my opinion, but this phone is not all it's cracked up to be.    Ohh and one very disappointing thing this phone does is, it gets screen burn-in easily.  If you use the same app constantly, like maps, it will absolutely leave ghost images on the screen.  Just like early plasma televisions.  I know there are apps that will fix this, it's not permanent, unlike the old plasma tvs, but really?  I was kind of stunned to have this happen.  And with no Samsung app to fix it, when they know it will happen, that's pretty disappointing.",YouTube
1722,"No offense but you are stupid as hell if you actually like the curved edges. I don't care if it looks cool, when it makes my phone unfunctional in so many ways then it is not worth it. I still accidently press things - this problem is improved when I have a case on my phone. And worst, my screen is  not responsive to touch almost at all when things inevitably end up on the curved edges, particularly when I am playing games on my phone this is a huge problem for me. Not to mention my finger often slides down the edges, part of this is thanks to the weird ass aspect ratio of this phone. Like wtf  As for the fingerprint scanner, yes it's annoying where it is. I can't reach it that well, it's too small to respond to my print half the time.. it would have been better put underneath the back camera, and made round not skinny and rectangular. It's faster for me to use my pincode to unlock than it is to use the finger print reader, that's how retarded the reader is.   Don't even get me started on the fact that this phone is encased entirely in glass.. seriously?   Overall, I really think Samsung super missed the mark design wise here. Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful to look at. But in many ways, the design of this phone makes it less functional as a phone for an everyday person.  This was my first Galaxy, and I probably won't buy another one. I wish I had gone with the Pixel instead. As someone who used the Nexus line for a long time, I wanted to change things up but it didn't work out for me. Google makes things more clean and streamline and they win more points for having the best voice assistant and for not including a shit ton of bloatware. Samsung made things too complicated and idiotic just to seem cool and pretty.",YouTube

I put the extra label inside the box since FedEx will not let you affix two labels to the box. So when you call them they tell you that you should have shipped the items back separately because they are going to different addresses but that is not true because the labels have the same address on them. When you return it they say that you did not use the correct label and they do not return your money. So not only are they sending out defective products, they are also stealing your money. I know because I am a victim",YouTube

I find that cases (I use the Samsung clear case) can make it much easier to find it with your finger and also avoid finding the camera lens because the recess helps steer your finger to the right place. 2.

A story recently emerged from South Korea claiming some Galaxy S8 devices are exhibiting reddish hues from their OLED panels. I decided to evaluate ten Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus displays in an attempt to identify the reported issue. Keep in mind, these are only ten devices (a relatively small sample) therefore this evaluation can't be completely conclusive. Nonetheless it should give you some idea of smartphone display variance in general and how that applies to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. If you've got a Samsung Galaxy S8 exhibiting the reported issues (red hue that can't be fixed) please leave a comment below.

2041,"Sure you won't get ""burn in"" in the turn on display feature, but for sure in the navbar. I am no expert but I once read that it's not burn in but that the screen in the black portions it's less consumed. Let me explain. Theoretically in AMOLEDs (OLEDs) the pixel is the led. When the pixel it's turn on it has a color, when not it's black. So like all AMOLEDs (Ex.: Nexus 6 & 6p) if the navbar is always black (or most time), sooner or later you will see a bar at the bottom of your screen that it's ""brighter"" than the rest of the screen because it has been more time turned off than other pixels.  Also the buttons in the navbar may look burned in but really they are contrasting with the intensity of the screen where the navbar pixels have been turned off. Following this theory the white buttons pixels remain turned on in a specific color wich with time get washed away because the lack of brightness (they are more ""consumed"").  This is just a theory that I once read and sustains that not matter what, if you have an AMOLED screen with navigation buttons you will for sure get this effect. It doesn't matter if you don't see it, it will happen. For example on the pixel c that has navigation buttons this won't happen because has an LTPS IPS LCD panel. A burn in (no powerless pixels XD) could happen but it would need hours of turn on static screen.  Hope this helps. If this it's just ridiculous I can guarantee for sure that in all my AMOLED screens I got this ""burn in"" :D",YouTube
2042,He guy is really stupid and annoying. I have seen his other videos too. He advertises more than explaining the topic at hand. He chooses some of the worst topics.

2052,"Don't give wrong information. Actually, we can have a static image in a LED Displays, not on OLED. Super Amoled is an OLED display so we should not keep a static image in smartphones with Super AMOLED Display. This is the reason we don't see laptops with Super AMOLED Display or OLED Panel because many this in Windows are static like Title Bar, Task Bar, Wallpaper.",YouTube

2078,"I don't know why AMOLED are so popular or maybe just with the Tech reviewers.  Personally I prefer LCD over AMOLED, AMOLED always has the blue tint when viewed from an angle and the burn-in issue.",YouTube
2079,"It's not leaving the static image on for hours at a time that causes burn-in (though this will do it). It's the cumulative effect of having the screen display the same thing for a lot of its life. The fact that the button is visible a large proportion of the time means that burn-in will occur. However, it's probably not going to be too noticeable. Even after two years, the burn-in on the navigation bar of my S5 is still pretty faint.  I noticed in the video that depending on the content, the S8 home button inverts colours. This means that it will actually be reversing the effects of burn-in, some of the time (while burn-in is irreversible, displaying an inverted image basically burns the rest of the screen in to match).",YouTube
2080,that intro looked like trump,YouTube
2081,it's an issue on almost all AMOLED displays I've had. Even if the buttons text shift around the bars will eventually start burning in.,YouTube

If you use this phone as a demo phone on full brightness and it's running 17 hours a day I don't think this is a real ""issue"" BEACUSE YOU DON'T F*CKING USE A PHONE FOR 17HOURS ON FULL BRIGHTNESS.

2105,"I don't have a S8, I'm still using a note 5. My screen has so many burnt in images it's ridiculous. especially from watching YouTube vertically instead of horizontally.   When's the note 8 dropping?! hurry up Samsung.",YouTube

2112,i havent experinced a burn in,YouTube
2113,"Hi, it's Kougeru. Image at 2:01 is my photo. The photograph was taken in a completely dark room with no flash, and the S8 was displaying a solid gray image. It wasn't noticeable on most other images. I first noticed it on the Discord app when I was using it in bed one day night.  There's a few responses I've seen on the internet I'd like to reply to.   1. This was in fact a consumer model. Bought it from Verizon. Was not used. Obtained on launch day, not a display model.   2. It never went away no matter how long I waited. It was permanent.  3. I only used the phone for under a week, and only like 3 or so hours a day. I didn't have a case so I only used it at home while waiting for my case to arrive.  4. I did not use Always-On display except for overnight once to check the effect it would have on battery.  5. I did not have the brightness near 100%, ever. I mostly left it on auto except when I set to 0% at night.   Lastly, to everyone calling me a liar....  Why? Why would I fake this? I don't work for competition. I've used Galaxy phones for since my 2nd android (first was a budget LG). I'm still using my S5 right now (my replacement S8 had a separate display issue and I decided to wait to see what the Note 8 would offer). I don't make any money off my reddit post or my photograph that many people have used without crediting me. I have absolutely nothing to gain from this. I even stated that I was a fairly certain I just had bad luck. Other people on reddit confirmed they had the same issue. We all just had bad luck. We accept we're in the minority.   My only goal from this was to show ""burn-in"" like this is definitely possible even with light use, if you have bad luck like I do. It's not noticeable to most people because most don't use their phones on low brightness on dark backgrounds like I do. I only wanted to show people that it **can** happen. I never stated it would happen on a large scale. I'm not a liar I find it bizarre that anyone would accuse me faking this when I have nothing to gain from it.",YouTube
2114,that's why I love my HTC One m8 cause 3 years of super heavy use and not a problem at all not even a frozen screen and it's still performing excellent like the first day.,YouTube

2123,I have screen burn in on my S8 & Samsung don’t cover it pls help,YouTube
2124,"Gosh all you people saying it is from people who want the S8 to look bad. Well news flash. It isn't perfect...from the finger print scanner, to earphones labelled as AKG yet isn't made by them and only tuned by them to screen defaulting to FHD to average battery life to red tint to half baked features. It's nothing new.",YouTube

2138,"Man some cunts says LCD is better than Amoled thinks their LCD won't have any issues. This is just a burn in. Just that as if it damages your digitizer or internal stuff of your phone.. I had a cellphone with IPS LCD, it's a local brand cellphone here.  Had couple of issues with it like there's a bright dots on some parts of screen. Scratches have that rainbow effect. Screen got burned by UV from sun(You can see it when you turn off the phone). No cracks been with me since 2015.",YouTube

2142,I am a fan boy but I must say Samsung build shit Smartphones(performance) ... Oneplus is well better  PS. The ram management sucks too,YouTube
2143,did you get the latest update that recently got released. this fixed the lag on my s8,YouTube
2144,"A close friend of mine bought one, and the launcher would sometimes lag without any apps installed.. Never seen that happening with a phone this expensive. Even the iPhone 5s on ios 10 is better optimized than the s8, imo. lol",YouTube
2145,take it easy it still an android phone,YouTube
2146,The galaxy note 3 was the last samsung phone that was actually worth getting,YouTube
2147,your phone is loaded with bunch of apps.  what do you expect?,YouTube
2148,"its two things that make the s8 or any samsung device run like shit its the samsung launcher and the samsung services first thing I do is diable as many samsung feature with package disabler app, and then put the pixel launcher on the device then i run the device at high performance at all times and disable all battery saving features or anything that will slow the phone down including safety features from samsung. once you do all this you will always have an all most lag free experience close to stock performance.",YouTube
2149,The truth hurts samsung fanboys !,YouTube
2150,"I bought the s8 and used it for a week, not impressed at all it's going back my honor 8 preforms better I swear. I wanted to love this phone and it's a let down. The finger print sensor is slow and not accurate compared to my honor 8. It pisses me off. I did a 30 second slow-mo video and the phone was burning up and the lag was real. I have about 60 apps on the phone.",YouTube
2151,Sounds like someone tried to root the phone and it messed up the boot loader,YouTube
2152,"Man, has to be sabotage. I am on my phone every minute of the day. I have not had any lag or restart.",YouTube
2153,I've been using the 256Gb MicroSD that came with my NOTE 7 and I have Zero problems with my S8,YouTube
2154,My S8 shut off yesterday and it was really slow even when it turned back on.,YouTube
2155,I returned my S8 for the same problem going back to my iPhone,YouTube
2156,"I have an S8, and this think just will not stop rebooting.  I've tried a factory reset, and it keeps happening.  I installed an app called SD Card Monitor, and have discovered that the SD card unmounts and remounts itself several times over a 5 minute period, all day long!  Sometimes, this will cause the phone to lock up, freeze, and then go to a black screen; Then it will show a lock icon with a Green and Blue circle around it, before loading the actual lock screen with the notification that date and time has been auto updated.  Oh, and it also wipes away all the apps and data that you put on the SD card.  Plus, if you customized your app drawer, you can forget about that, because every time the phone reboots, all the apps are reorganized for you!  When the apps do appear, they sometimes appear as a grey icon showing an SD card logo, or as a generic Android Alien, with ""com.[APPNAME].[PROCESS]"" instead of the usual app name.  I am not pleased, a nearly $1000 device should not be doing this, especially after their last product would spontaneously combust.",YouTube
2157,"That shit just happened to me earlier today, I was watching vids the vid froze up and a noise just kept repeating and it rebooted.",YouTube
2158,Not having that issue. Got my free VR today!,YouTube
2159,My phone has randomly shut off several times since launch. It may have been rebooting but I held the power button to turn it on before it had a chance. it also has randomly froze several times. nothing that crazy though. and not that often,YouTube
2160,Mine rebooted once yesterday. Freaked me out. Hope they push out a fix for it soon.,YouTube
2161,Same shit every year. Samsung is trash along with android.,YouTube
2162,Been a Samsung user for a really long time but I am really annoyed with the s8+ that i bought. i do have that random restart issue but not everyday. the most annoying issue that i have is when I go to contacts and try to click on Call to make a call and nothing would happen until few seconds to even minutes. when my partner got the phone at same time with me but never had those issues and we both use the same sd card. but yet it might be the sd card. cause i get the unsupported sd card msg every now and then. if any of you guus are having these issues let me know if u found a fix. tnx,YouTube

2165,"Greggles! What's up, bro?",YouTube
2166,Yes having auto reboot happening constantly.. it's so look annoying.. having to change my display back to bright and put up the volume switching back to phone rotate position.. etc.. really pissing me off!!!! a unlock logo appears on the screen as it's doing it,YouTube
2167,haven't had rebooting issue but there's a pretty intense lag. I haven't done a hard reset yet but it's getting pretty annoying. the lags have been up to about 1 minute or more. it kind of makes me think maybe I should waited for all the bugs to be worked out. thanks for your video.,YouTube
2168,Yeah it's also happening  on my galaxy s7,YouTube
2169,"My S8+ reboots at least six times thru out the week. My S8+ just rebooted 8 minutes ago and that is how I found this video since I am researching why is this happening. My WiFi also disconnects all the time.  I have the Samsung 256gb SD card in my S8+. I called Samsung on Friday and they were not much help. The person wants me to run in safe mode for a few days to see if reboot happens.  I might just do that to see what happens but yeah this is getting me very upset that a 1,000 dollar phone has these issues.",YouTube
2170,"My s8 plus has restarted on me twice already.  Once while watching youtube on highest video quality.   The phone got really hot then made a buzzing sound along with screen artifacts then it restarted.  The second time it restarted on me is when I was casting a movie to my chrome cast mid movie.  I do not have a SD card in my phone at all.  I am debating on returning phone, but the inventory is very low and I really cannot be out of a phone while waiting for a warranty swap out.",YouTube
2171,my S8+ reboots every 30 minutes or so all day long.,YouTube
2172,my s8+ auto restarts once in awhile.,YouTube

2175,"I have this issue I don't know what to do :( , why me , sometimes my s8 changes song of something else when someone calls me and it reboots it self while also turning the fucking song on and I don't know how to stop song because screen black buttons doesn't work also sometimes my ducking battery dies so fast :(",YouTube
2176,see this is why u to wait a few months to buy  when complex gadgets are released,YouTube
2177,Why so many problems?  Was about to pick one up now not sure. Maybe early bugs.,YouTube
2178,"1st s8+ I had, after 2 days att swapped it out for me. I also returned sd card and got another new one. Samsung pro select model. the new s8+ started doing it also. it even would really arrange  my apps on home screen, and eventually the phone deleted them off the home screen, still in drawer though. called samsung, they sent me to Samsung store, they didn't find anything wrong, but flashed it and suggested not using sd card until it is fixed.  after about 12 days I returned the phone since there has been no comment or solution from Samsung and did not want to get stuck with it after the 14 days.",YouTube
2179,I have this issue,YouTube
2180,I have the Galaxy s8 does anyone have lag or unresponsive issues? When my phone is charging and I am typing sometimes the phone flips out and starts deleting my text or just type gibberish on the stock keyboard for Samsung and SwiftKey as well. Does anyone else have issues where the phone becomes unresponsive for a few seconds where the phone is frozen but it allows you to click the back and home button multiple times before it responds? Besides from these two issues the phone is great. I hate gorilla glass 5 terrible with scratches. Just awful.,YouTube
2181,I think I saw a setting that will make the phone reboot intermittently.  Maybe they turned that on and forgot.,YouTube
2182,have had no problems at all phone  on rebooting  only complain i have is battery life sucks,YouTube
2183,"I haven't heard of that problem either, so it's only xda guys huh??? sound fishy to me",YouTube

2185,cool samsung s8 greg,YouTube
2186,That restarting problem has happened to me about 3 times now but it hasn't happened again.,YouTube
2187,"My Samsung galaxy s8 is properly the worst and has never been rooted. Now it been going through multiple crashes: TouchWiz, Bluetooth, Google, settings, and more. It would freeze and reboot or gets stuck on the boot screen even on safe mode continues on with the issue. Have already done all the factory reset process and sd card unmount",YouTube
2188,"I have the S8+ and been having the same issue! Called Samsung and they say that it may be a downloaded app, but can't be.  I removed apps they I downloaded and then the issue is still present.",YouTube
2189,I found it's temperature related it's winter now and every time I get my phone out outdoors it keeps rebooting  but indoors it doesn't happen,YouTube
2190,"Yep, I'm having issues with my S8 randomly rebooting. I'm still troubleshooting. It's been away for repair, where I was told 'a problem' was fixed of random reboots. Within a day of getting it back it was rebooting. If I use the phone in safe mode it's fine. I also replaced the SD card, but no joy. The next step is to remove my SD card, which is a real pain as all my music is there. But my gut feeling is that it is app related. I recently ditched my Windows phone to escape the crapness, but at least it was reliable. I'm not saying I'd go back to Windows though, but considering the cost of the cost of the S8 I imagined phone heaven after my dark days on a Windows phone.",YouTube
2191,"just bought 1 week ago,. After i bought the s8+ i restore my files from s7. I dont even use SD nor tried to root it but it occasionally restarts the phone. sometime its on ""Samsung is starting...Optimizing App.."" which it starts from 35 until 98 and its on loop. Once it reach 98, it goes back to 35 and same process. I cannot turn off my phone as well, i have wait for my battery to finish itself.

2195,My samsung C7 is also restarting several times after freezing. I am getting this problem when i sit in cold room where temp is probably below 20 to 22 degrees after some time when mobile become cold it going to restart. where temperature is more than that it runs very smoothly and don't restart by itself. How could i fix this problem of freezing mobile?,YouTube
2196,Its probably resets so much cause they use them too much. I did a test on my brothers s8 and my s8 plus I had to play any game on the device till the phone was to hot it would keep rebooting. So anyways people either use it to a point where the phone is hot or there is a problem with the phone,YouTube
2197,"Wow, well I'm not getting this phone, I'm getting iPhone 7 plus, too many bad reports",YouTube
2198,Rebooting freezing. And worst of all Damn screen blows up when you drop the phone and repeating it is impossible. When you break the screens you are better to buy another new 1000 dollar phone. Who has that kind of cash to replace complete phone.,YouTube

I don't mind Bixby, I use it every now and then, but the button is in a spot where I naturally put pressure when hitting the power button to turn the screen off. I'm sure it is something I will get used to, but I think they could have positioned it better, maybe above the power button.",YouTube

2257,"sheesh your slamming these videos out tonight bro!   I remember the gallery on my s5 did that, but much slower",YouTube
2258,Nice work sir!,YouTube
2259,"I know is offtopic but, is google+ working to you? I've being like 3 days in a row without getting any notificaction from google+, it doesnt' work at all. I notice the coments and so thanks to youtube app Lol",YouTube
2260,Nice one...,YouTube
2261,"Hi,  Does S8 PLUS fit in the Pocket when we put bumper case on it?",YouTube
2262,since my s8 updated  about a month ago it lags.  you open photos and their not full size right away.,YouTube
2263,thanks sir very nice video subscribed to u kindly suggest me phone upto 40000 rupees india which has gud camera and doent heats sir honor 8 pro and one plus5 doent have gud camera should i wait,YouTube
2264,Try out 3 S8 plus and all has screen reddish tint issue performance excellent and fingerprint easier than S8. S8 plus has lower PPI than S8 might be this the reason why a tad faster!. Use 1080P ,YouTube
2265,Could it be because you have many pics in S8's gallery as opposed to the Plus? Try reproducing the issue by mass downloading pics on Plus,YouTube
2266,even my S7 doesn't lag on any app also not on gallery app. I think it's fake video,YouTube

2271,Nice video,YouTube
2272,awesome job on the video,YouTube
2273,You used other channel's B roll I think you should give them credit. How can you say the GS8 problems if you used a Store model? Store models don't have good battery life as they're always plugged in so the battery degrades. Anyways nice vid.,YouTube
2274,"never good battery life yeah? guess who was king of battery life ij 2017 (except mate 9, axon 7 and op3t). yes 4th place was s7 edge",YouTube
2275,This guy speaks fake issues,YouTube
2276,"Sure the battery life could be better but saying it is bad based on past things is unfair... using that logic, wouldn't that make every person and company to ever exist bad?",YouTube
2277,"But you shouldn't compare the S8 with the iPhone. Each and every single one of android phones is slower than the iPhone. iOS is optimized and the apps are super optimized. The battery life was one thing that they could've improved but since they wanted a sleek phone so that wasn't possible but I think that it would still last longer than the iPhone. And I totally agree with you on the bugs, but they'll soon be diminished after some updates.  And the Apps would be slowly optimized to fit the screen. That's the thing on which you're really nitpicking.  And No the battery won't explode ",YouTube

2283,I feel Bixby and Fingerprint sensor are major issues for me!???,YouTube
2284,Samsung is definitely in the first place. No doubt!  Oh and by the way the worst possible thing any phone company could do is follow Apple. Do you have the phone? How can you even say Samsung has bad battery when Apple absolutely stinks in battery life. Anyways decent video but I think if you going to make so many claims and comparisons it would be helpful to actually have the phone in hand. Just some constructive criticism?,YouTube

2391,"Regarding the phone, I've been using it for 15 days now, and I don't like it. My observations:  •All the biometric scanners are clunky to use. The fingerprint scanner works almost everytime only with the third try. iris scanner is fast but aligning the phone with your eyes isn't. Even face unlock doesn't work in all lighting conditions. •The camera is unable to capture sharply anything which is in motion. A stray cat at my home always comes blurry whenever I try to click her. Faces come out completely weird at the slightest of movements. The effect is as if the soul is leaving the body. Plus it still suffers from the aggressive post processing like the s7. Zooming into photos, a lot of artificial sharpening and detail loss is evident. Overexposed tree leaves in bright sunlight is common. Yes, there is the pro mode but try fiddling with the controls in it. It is super annoying that every time I try to change the ISO or other settings the markers requires such patience and dexterity that the slightest mis-tap results in the mode going off or camera switching to selfie mode. Please try both the moving subject capture and pro mode. You'll see what I'm saying. •The charging tech is still 3 years old. Compared to Oneplus, this flagship phone outputs only 9.0 V and is based on quickcharge 2.0 tech. •There is just no visual consistency to the software. Yes, it is smooth and fast but there's lack of visual consistency. I have a news app which sometimes zooms in to open and sometimes slides form the left. Most apps when scaled look disproportionate and the rounded icons feature destroys the app faces by cutting them. These are minor issues, but I'm quite sensitive to lag and hate inconsistency. I get that Samsung is trying to make the apps look more like those on the iPhone but the app icons on iPhones don't get cut and are more beautiful to look at. There's beauty in symmetry. Not on the s8 plus. •App crashes. For some reason, Instagram and Highway riders apps crash a lot. I had 70+ errors in less than 7 days. Other apps also misbehave at times. Freezing, opening with a lot of weird stutters and frame rate drops, randomly showing the navigation bar while in a game are visual irritants which don't leave a pleasant experience. •Multitasking. The aggressive closing of apps in the background still persists and even light games like temple run and subway surfers don't remain open after having opened four or five other apps. The iPhone kept them open till 15 other apps were not opened and sometimes I had the game stay where I left it even after 2 days. Admittedly these two days did not comprise heavy usage of any sort. Yet, there is no such intelligent background app management with Samsung. If you don't open an app for 6 hours, it will restart no matter how heavy or light your usage has been in the meantime. •There are other minor issues like charging that sometimes stops and I have to constantly look at the phone to see if it is going on. Happened only twice in the last 15 days. Minor point but a great irritant to peace of mind.  These have been my observations. When I think that I sold my iPhone to get this, I don't feel happy. It is just not as coherent a device, not as consistent or polished. It just looks beautiful and the one handed usage is slightly better than the 7 plus but I still don't like it due to the above-mentioned reasons. These are, of course, personal observations and they may or may not happen with others.",YouTube
2392,"What the fuck do you want to play on an Exynos?  If you would use an S8 with Snapdragon instead of exynos would be better, exynos is made for office working , not games, snapdragon is made for playing game intesively",YouTube

I know its suck.  is exynos version r good for daily device? im a gamer also, but im not an emulator gamer so is this phone good for games? such as heavy game on playstore and fps game? i dont really care about ram management maybe it needs to get 3rd party app to manage ram, i'll search em on xda forum or similiar forum they r really good at this. sorry if my english is bad.",YouTube

2421,"Anyone else's S8 get uncomfortably warm often? I switched from the LG G6 because of how hot it got under standard and even somewhat minimal tasks reaching over 116 degrees. My new S8 reaches a maximum of 110 degrees which is enough to make the metal extremely hot to touch and enough to melt ice when applied to cool it down.  I've noticed my phone behaves slightly better when I have signed out of my AVG anti-virus app, but that shouldn't be the cause exactly as it still gets uncomfortably warm.. Using wireless charing with Samsung's convertible pad does cause more warmth than a charging cable but I can not determine what causes the most heat. When apps and processes are closed including cache and other background features it still remains quite warm. My battery drains very quickly too to the point where I've lowered my resolution to standard res and downloaded a pixel disabling program to lower the resolution further along with another program to do the same with sleeping apps that no longer need to work. I've troubleshooted everything about my device and doubt its just a bad phone, as literally every LG phone I owned previously was defective and caused multiple returns. I don't wear a case either, so I am very curious to know if any other users are experiencing a very warm phone with poor battery life.

2494,colleague already refunded his s8. about to do the same in the morning. speaker audio broken. most sound wont play or fades in and out. seems software related but going to get a refund before the statutory refund period is over.

2507,Bxactions is a much better app for remapping the Bixby button. No lag,YouTube
2508,"Maybe its just me, but I much prefer the FP scanner where it is compared to the home button on my old S7. I never could get the scanner to be dependable enough to justify using over a pin code on the S7. Meanwhile on the S8+ I can depend on it 99.9% of the time.   Maybe I just have large hands, or maybe this is just an easy target to an otherwise great phone that people have to find something wrong with.",YouTube
2509,why has no one made a case with a sliding camera cover? surely that would not only protect the camera lense more but only leave the fp scanner? maybe ill email spigan! ?,YouTube

2523,Certainly many issues with the tempered glass but it's always better to see a crack on 500rs glass than the expensive 25k INR S8 display!!,YouTube
2524,"That's So terrible! This tempered Glass totally ruins the touch experience & feel of the Galaxy S8. Superb video. Sir, is there any official & authentic Screen protector recommended by Samsung for it's S8 ??!",YouTube
2525,Really bad news for those who wants to use Tempered glass on S8.! Thanks for the video Sir.,YouTube
2526,I got your point. Once it is broken it's of no use! Thanks for sharing..  So you're saying the ?500 tempered glass didn't help when it fell down! it didn't save the main display at all! ? #S8  #GizmoTimesYTGiveaway,YouTube
2527,Looks like there is an so many issues if you buy tempered glass for galaxy S8 not fitting correctly & even if fits than you unable to use back cover & if display broken than nothing left for said ? agree with you avoid tempered glass & try protective tough back cover is an good option at some of extends it helps lil bit to save your valuable galaxy S8 screen. #GizmoTimesYTGiveaway,YouTube

Major upset from smartphone glass also breaking for small from even from 2 feet..!! That's not good built quality in that high end Samsung devices.

2541,Your glass is verry cheap my friend invest more then 25eur,YouTube
2542,Well if one is not rough like I know most of you are you don't need a screen protector. Unless you don't give a fuck then by all means get one,YouTube
2543,Take care of your phone dude!,YouTube
2544,yeah you cracked it thats why it has so many problems u are so dumb,YouTube
2545,Good point! Very useful.,YouTube
2546,I just got a film protector  I dont drop my phone alot,YouTube
2547,That's why I use a plastic screen protector?,YouTube
2548,I thought protector did help you with the falls.  It cracks instead of your phone cracking.,YouTube
2549,I get the same issue with pulling down the notification bar with tempered glass what should ? do?,YouTube
2550,my family and I bought already 4 s8/s8+ and 3 of them are already broken!! they all had Otterbox cases and premium tempered glass and it didn't helped! the S8 screen is amazingly fragile specially when hitting on one of the screen corners.,YouTube

2557,I prefer good quality Case like UAG case with wet screen protector.,YouTube
2558,Sir according to you which screen protector is better?,YouTube
2559,get a tpu screen protector it works well but definitely no plastic screen protector it no good,YouTube
2560,"OKAY, here is the problem from an expert who have tridd every single brand availible and spent close to $1200 and a couple rebuys. So out of ALL tempered glass the main one suggested by samsung and designed by samsung for the flagship s8 release is the otterbox alpha tempered s8 glass. It retail's for $50  BUT HERE IS THE KICKER NOBODY UNDERSTANDS..IF YOU BUY THE OTTERBOX BRAND GLASS IT IS 100% MEANT TO BE BOUGHT AND USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE S8 OTTERBOX BRAND CASE BECAUSE IT HOLDS THE GLASS EVENLY ON ALL EDGES IN PLACE WITHOUT ALLOWING IT TO SLIDE AROUND AND GET PRESSURE CRACKS. IF YOU ALSO USE THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR WITHOUT THE OTTERBOX BRAND CASE  SPECIFICALLY (VIA USING ANOTHER CASE OR ONLY THE SCREEN PROTECTOR WITH NO CASE) IT IS GUARENTEED TO CRACK. i know all of this from countless buys and tries.",YouTube
2561,S8 the best,YouTube

2564,Watching On Galaxy S6Edge ..?,YouTube
2565,*htc u 11 the king babe* ??,YouTube
2566,I didnt understand why Samsung jump from 16MP to 12MP. They should improve low light and fast shooter on 16MP.,YouTube
2567,"S8 does not do ""over noise reduction"". It is the S7 that makes oversharpening.",YouTube
2568,glad I stuck with my s6,YouTube
2569,"In fact.. Noise can add some ""fake-sharpness"" .. also the old S-Series (S7 and S6) has added fake-sharpness (edge-sharpening with light halo around edges). That make some artificial sharpness (easy to see on the grass of the s6-picture) - and including with noise it can seem : ""thats more texture"" ... But besides that : the picture with the leaves isnt explainable with what i wrote above. But the s8 (like every smartphone) has a hard time occasionally to find the right focus.  I can show you on every smartphone comparison (pixel , lg g6 etc) there are few out of focus pictures which in comparison with other phones look like ""smudged"" ... Its hard to tell objectiv - wether or how much the s8 isnt sharp. Also dxomark has measured that the s8 doesnt make sharp pictures (espescially in comparison with htc u11 , and pixel ,and s7 ). But its to easy to say : ""thats the noise-reduction""..  I dont think, that that is the ""whole"" answer. I think its because the multiframe-image-processing is (unfortunately) a very new thing for Samsung - and it isnt optimized  (they must improve it (image stacking, lucky imaging) in the future with updates)  - than the S8 camera could perform much better ,i think.   Also dont forget : the S6 get (camera)-updates since 2 years ... and the S8 is fresh out. Hopefully the S8 camera (-software) will be improved with time.  Because the competition is really hard.",YouTube
2570,S6 is the best in series till now with some how perfect to other s series !!!!!,YouTube
2571,Samsung wins,YouTube
2572,you should do the note series,YouTube
2573,"I think the sample pictures from the S8 are not actually from the S8. I have an S8 and it takes way better pictures than the ones in this video. I'm not a Samsung fanboy, I always used iPhones and still have. Recently bought an S8 and comparing to my iPhone 7 I'm not too excited about the S8's performance but it does take better pictures than these. Just saying...",YouTube
2574,s7 slays,YouTube
2575,of course HTC returned ??????????????????????,YouTube
2576,dang,YouTube
2577,the samsung producing the problems and update it then we have some crazy  smartphone!!!!!!!!!,YouTube
2578,compare front shooter too :D anyway s8 latest and greatest design is TOP worth every cent no one gonna buy s7 its already 1yo phone :D  pure black phone hype is real every phone last 2yrs quality are  10% difference max have to look under microscope to difference  but design is  master prio   s8 is futuristic,YouTube
2579,S6,YouTube
2580,"Funny comparison, is there anyone who will take the same shoot with S5, S6, S7 & S8 in the real daily life? I have S5 & S7, but will not take the same shoot with both phone",YouTube
2581,"The images are sooo close to each other that it really makes no sense to make a video out of it. Differences are hardly to see, and if then only if comparing it with two pictures side by side. For a normal user all 4 phones make just the same good quality photos.",YouTube
2582,"This is not an issue, the S6 has a higher megapixel camera, they dropped to 12 for better low light. Detail is the compromise, we know this. As for the processing, overall it is better on the S8 but that doesn't mean that it is better in every single instance.",YouTube
2583,"I can't relate to this as an S8 owner. I will test it myself later this day against my old Galaxy S6. I only noticed that the S8 captured more detail when compared to the S6 in all shots.... From your comparision, I prefer the S6 in general. It simply had the nicest shots. If your S8-pictures were in focus as mine takes them, then S8 anytime due to better dynamic range and always having bokeh even with pictures from a distance as shown in your very first photo.",YouTube
2584,Somebody forgot to clean his camera lens! lol,YouTube
2585,i have both s8+ and s7 edge and camera on s8 is much better. and s6 edge + can't even hold a candle to this two.  this video is straight up misleading.,YouTube
2586,Samsungs pull too much light sometimes. In my experience. With all the low light shit. Becomes unnatural.,YouTube
2587,"Samsung garbage.....they just concentrated on the thin bezels...they figure the camera can hold its own...small screen. Sorry I don't count the curve section, because its blurred.",YouTube
2588,the funny thing is I don't have any of these ....still watching....,YouTube
2589,"As a photographer, i would suggest to go in and fix any detail in pictures that is not correct. Of course you shouldn't stick with original photo there is always something to fix up??. Nice video",YouTube
2590,It because you don't have it..,YouTube
2591,so much buttraped SamScum Fanboys with Stockholm Syndrome xD,YouTube
2592,"even though I don't own an S8 you are major nitpicking how many people buy cell phone for a camera with the quality of an HDR?, all four pictures look fine as far as I'm concerned",YouTube
2593,S6 had a better camera for stills imo with the higher MP but was bad for movememt photos.,YouTube
2594,You got a faulty unit,YouTube
2595,Oh come on!,YouTube
2596,What about selfies?,YouTube
2597,Coming from Note 4 i am raging how bad the cam on s8plus is.,YouTube
2598,just watched this  also on moving  pics they arent very good on moving pics on s8,YouTube
2599,The s8 has a real problem..i have noticed this too with my s8,YouTube
2600,I bought my Samsung Galaxy S8+ about a month ago. My pictures are there one minute and the next there not. I don't understand what happens to the pictures that I take. I have had two very special events that I took pictures for.  Pictures have disappeared why? I'm so disappointed because I have no pictures of my special events. Went to sprint and they have no idea what's happening. I'm so upset by this.,YouTube
2601,"Why don't you have more views, We need to tell samsung they are being a bunch of idiots!!",YouTube
2602,So learn how to take photos..,YouTube
2603,It's not smoother. It's more aggressive HDR bringing up shadow exposure giving the illusion of texture softening. Add contrast and it has just as much detail as the others.,YouTube
2604,I'd take your s8 back for a replacement if your s8 is worse than the older models. I did a comparison with the s8 and s7e with over 70 photos on each and cam confirm that in no way is the s7s camera better.  In literally no way. Get ur unit replaced.,YouTube
2605,Galaxy S8 is best Galaxy S7 had HDR on Galaxy S6 has a higher mp count Galaxy s5 is trash,YouTube
2606,just bought an s8 and to say I am disappointed would be an understatement. not only are the photos rubbish but also when viewing photos taken with my canon DSLR on the s8 the resolution is appalling with no details seen at all just a very annoying shimmer effect. black lines appear around objects that aren't there in real life and all together I have to say the camera on the Samsung galaxy s8 is actually completely shit.,YouTube
2607,watching this on my galaxy s6 ;),YouTube
2608,"this dude owns a iPhone , s8 has the best cam with all the effects he's not using",YouTube

2613,Samsung is dead,YouTube
2614,samsung g is overpriced trash,YouTube
2615,S6 def the best. I have an S6 Active and it has an amazing camera. I even compared it to the LG V10 in low light and it performed better. S6 still the king tbh!,YouTube
2616,s6 is best camera,YouTube
2617,this is basically b******* video the cameras are great I don't know what he's talking about and he's not really known for knowing about cameras he's only known for having Windows phones or being a Windows fanboy so I don't know why he's reviewing the camera for on the smartphone,YouTube
2618,"some of the shots might look blurry due to the multi frame processing, which takes 3 shots one after another. So any small movement might add blur.",YouTube
2619,please can u review the htc u11 camera guys,YouTube
2620,welcome back HTC....,YouTube
2621,i think the problem with your eyes,YouTube
2622,"I'm sorry, but this just looked like you were looking for reasons to bash on the S8. Coming from an S6 Edge user.",YouTube
2623,"What the fuck is this video? Or are you a bad photographer, or you prepare the pictures ... How is it all about me? And some S8 pictures are made with zoom ... I do not know what you're trying to do, but it's ok ...",YouTube
2624,why not combine S6's high megapickle camera with S7's low light camera to produce a sharper low light camera? (Dual Camera),YouTube
2625,crazy people buy Samsung products they don't know it steal their mony,YouTube
2626,"I'm not a picture taker myself. Can't say I care. If I want pictures, I'll buy an actual camera.",YouTube
2627,YES it is definitely really interesting. In fact Samsung in somehow needs to see this by themselves absolutely.,YouTube
2628,"I am Sorry But Nobody gives A Fuck about such Very Tiny Differences I Hardly could notice any Difference between All Four Normal people wouldn't give a shit about how such minor things coz nobody has free time to zoom in and say OH LOOK THE COLOUR OF THAT TINY BUG IS OVERSATURATED , OH THAT TEXTURE OF THAT TILE IS MISSING , OH THE EXPOSURE IS QUITE AGGRESSIVE PS - I am not a Samsung Fanboy  BTW HTC U11 Holds the Crown for the Best Camera Right now",YouTube
2629,I'm not surprised by the results... They should've stuck with the s6 camera and just improved low light performance...I miss my S6 however the reason I got rid of it was because the ois in the camera is faulty and is a well known issue in the online forums...Great camera but not reliable,YouTube
2630,I have always said that the camera on the s6 was better than the s7...The s6 camera was really really nice... I'm using a iPhone 7plus and the camera is just amazing...I really appreciate how much more natural everything looks with the iphone,YouTube
2631,he is right,YouTube
2632,"I have a S6 and I think it has the best camera. Lowlight shots are poor but seeing as I take the majority of my shots during the day, no issue for me.",YouTube
2633,"i have the s7 and my brother has the s6 edge. whenever we go out on a trip for example, we always use his camera bcs it is seriously better than the s7, even my uncle's note 5 has a better camera. and its not like a side by side comparison when you notice the difference. you can easily tell if the photo was taken by the s6 or s7. but obviously in lowlight the s7 is a beast",YouTube
2634,"I think the s7 and s6 camera ..... I think those two had the best pictures,and that's crazy, since the s8 is newer.",YouTube
2635,@Phandroid  What if you use a different app  It should process the photo differently right?,YouTube
2636,The note 4 is FAR FAR FAR better than the s8 Im regretting buying an S8+ these new cameras plain suck. GET RID OF FUCKING NOISE REMOVAL. I thought I was the only one. Why the fuck do they do this. Disable ALL FUCKING NOISE REDUCTION!!!!,YouTube
2637,s7,YouTube
2638,That's strange because I have a S8 + and it works perfectly. I also typed this message using voice to text,YouTube
2639,No issues here whatsoever with pop ups and no issues with voice to text either lol. Funny how someone can make a video and say DON'T BUY THE GALAXY S8 because they are having a particular problem with THEIR device! That means the whole batch is garbage? Stick to iphones dude...what a troll video lmbo!,YouTube
2640,"Sorry to hear that. My S7 Works GREAT. No error messages and voice to text works great as well. My age old philosophy stands, never buy a new item that just came out. Let them work the bugs out before you buy it. Same goes for drugs, Doctors try and put me on new meds, they are expensive, and a year in you find out they have long lasting side effects... Sorry for your trouble friend.",YouTube

2644,Should've stuck with the IPhone lol,YouTube
2645,"I was hoping you'd shoot it. I have an s7, and it's crappy. Had a Note 4 before that and it was beautiful. Then the first update came and tore down all functionality and drained the battery faster, at times would die even while plugged into the wall losing 1% every half second. Samsung has gone downhill since.",YouTube
2646,I would never buy a Samsung phone.,YouTube
2647,thanks for the info,YouTube
2648,"No issues, Android rocks. However it's like the never ending argument of what truck manufacturer is better.",YouTube
2649,just got my s8 on July 31 and it does the same thing. every 5 minutes or so my wifi lose connection. it very frustrating. I still have a couple days left before I can't return it. I don't know what to do. why can't they just fix it!!!,YouTube
2650,"there is only one thing left to do!!!!   DO A DURABILITY TEST , fire that Magnum to your S8+ and see how it goes! :)",YouTube
2651,"1. the phone isn't heavy 2. if the voice to text doesn't work, use the keyboard 3. you shouldn't degrade a phone based on fixable issues  this is coming from a galaxy s8+ owner :)",YouTube
2652,no issues with mine,YouTube
2653,This type of hysteria is common for iPhone users switching over to Android. The feverish disorientation you are experiencing will soon subside as you discover what freedom feels like on your Android phone. Congratulations on your purchase.,YouTube
2654,You complain about the S8 being heavy but have no problem holding a gun. I see.,YouTube
2655,Maybe your Samsung S8+ needs a software update.,YouTube
2656,thank goodness my 8 plus doesn't do this,YouTube
2657,"Voice to text is horrible on the S8+. Even if you disable the Samsung software and opt for Google, the phone defaults to Samsung's. Even more annoying is that it horribly slows down (almost 20 seconds, at times) Google talk to text, if it works at all. This will work until the phone restores itself to Samsung voice input: Settings >> General management >> Language and input >> keyboards >> onscreen keyboards >> Manage keyboards check Google voice and un-check Samsung voice input.",YouTube
2658,I have a good solution use your gun to blast it.,YouTube
2659,seeems like at troll for lack of proof that anything was actually going wrong lol,YouTube
2660,S8 is better than Xperia,YouTube
2661,"still have the wifi bug. WILL NOT STAY CONNECTED TO WIFI. I am a 30+ years in IT. I am raising hell with samsung and Xfinity. the voice to text, you can fix, change it to google. I sit under a GOOD access point, phone will not connect automatically and will not stay connected after you manually connect. Which for me is important to save $60 a month, cause I do not want mobile date, it costs money...I have to work for money. Anyway, i figure this is programmed into the phones to not stay on wifi (it lowers sales of mobile data) very sad. ALSO, can't figure out how to send a video that does not look like a 1950 TV. sure, can send video, looks completely unacceptable, and I am easy to please.",YouTube
2662,I like how there is just a random gun on ur table,YouTube

2665,It has so many positive points in favor to not buy it,YouTube

2667,"I had the EXACT problem with my voice to texting, I did some research and its the Samsung keyboard causing this issue.  Download the Google keyboard and you will no longer have issues.  Fixed mine completely!",YouTube
2668,I have the Galaxy s8 and it's fine.,YouTube
2669,that really sucks! can you not get a replacement ? had mine a while and has been a delight to use. went for s8 which has been light and easy to use (the added screen size is enough). best phone on market in my opinion,YouTube
2670,you bought it to early they always have problems within the first couple month . If you want an amazing phone go for the samsung s7 edge . I have the s7 edge and it has never gave me problem and is better than my laptop !!!!!!!,YouTube

2672,"I have the DQA problem. I used to have the voice issue, then out of the blue I could use Google Assistant, type with my voice, and everything. however, DQA has stopped working continues. I used to be able to just disable Wi-Fi and use mobile data (I'm fortunate enough to have unlimited data), but the issue seemingly has extended to mobile data as well. I hope they release a patch soon.",YouTube

2676,they have fixed the voice to text with an update! it's a BRAND NEW PHONE! even iPhones have new software updates to fix bugs with new phones! I have had no issues with the WiFi issues you speak of! the s8 blows iphone out of the water!  they aren't even comparable! and lmfao....the phone is too heavy for you???!!! lmfao....you sound like a little girl! it's lighter than the iPhone plus!,YouTube

2921,You want to complain about the same industrial design of the iPhone like there isn't a reason. THEY GOT IT RIGHT. Think about all the phones that copied the design over the years. Practically every single smart phone in the last decade. iPhone X is a bit different but it's not like it's some wildly different design. It would be like complaining that cars still have 4 wheels or airplane still have wings. I get a lot of people have no clue about the intricacies of industrial design but the point is if its designed properly it doesnt have to be redesigned every single year or 5 years or decade.

My iPhone 6 was decent but had some trouble with the battery and Apple replaced it with another 6 that had 2 digitizers go haywire and on the 2nd bad charging port in a little over 2 years I’d had enough. Welcome iPhone 8... total junk. Just buy one and you can find out for yourself.

3220,..... but because is Apple they will never recall nothing.... i-ships will buy again even a faulty device.,YouTube
3221,Maybe they sourced the screen and battery from Samsung as a combo deal?,YouTube
3222,This is because of defective Lithum Ion Batteries. It is common for this to happen,YouTube
3223,This should be happening on iPhone X,YouTube
3224,Why are there no  issues coming up from in the states?,YouTube

3234,"Apple sells millions of these devices, and as stated, Apple is investigating these isolated incidents that have yet to be confirmed. Moreover, none of these supposed devices have caught fire, exploded, or been banned from commercial air travel, not to mention, Samsung’s debacle lead to the most expensive world wide recall in human history that forced governments to disallow them in public arenas such as airports because they were walking time-bomb’s. So far none of these reports have been confirmed, and comparing this to what happened to Samsung... is completely ridiculous.",YouTube

3282,same as the iphone plus i have. i return back to the telecom company..,YouTube
3283,It's battery blown problem,YouTube
3284,I have the same problem but on the right corner,YouTube
3285,"Good news. I took my iPhone 8 back and they immediately noticed the slightly raised screen. I don’t think it was due to battery swelling, I think it was just a bad glue job/quality control from the factory. Good luck to you all in getting a replacement. I think you have like 30 days to replace if you bought from ATT or whoever. Or if you got AppleCare  you should be set. I’m an apple fanboy but not to the point of brainwashing. They need to stop rushing shit to the release date and get the quality under control. Maybe they have peaked. Who knows.",YouTube
3286,I think it is normal i am from Germany and i got the same Problem  but my 7 plus got it too and the phones in the store :),YouTube
3287,I got the same problem nothing much to worry anyways the water proof works perfectly so I won’t worry why do I know the water proof works I dropped it in the pool in the deep end when I was tying to do the iPhone pinch challenge,YouTube
3288,you going to take a $1000+ ass raping before you realize apple hasn't taken any steps forward the last couple years? some would even argue they have taken steps backwards. give up on apple. lg and samsung make some really nice phones now. i think its time to take that next step yourself.,YouTube
3289,Dude same thing is happening with my phone rn its rising up from the bottom of the screen I can stick my finger nail correctly,YouTube
3290,imhave the exact same issue. my 6s is perfectly flush between screen and body but the 8 i just bought have a lift on some parts of the phone(if not all around the display) not a big lift but noticeable when running my finger over it. Back is completely flush but the screen.... I am extremely disappointed with apple. My wife convinced me to go for the 8 when i was ready to switch to android. Could you guys let us know how did you solved the issue and if you’ve managed to get your unit replaaced? Thanks,YouTube
3291,I Have the same problem with my iPhone 8,YouTube
3292,Do you have a Perfect replacement iphone?,YouTube
3293,Just got the iPhone 8 a few hours ago and I noticed this as well. Replacing mine tomorrow. It’s frustrating that there always seems to be a “gate” on the new stuff. But my 6s was flawless. Back of the 8 is fine. Only the screen feels rough on certain edges. I guess we will see on the charger overnight. Might wake up to a bloated split phone.,YouTube
3294,I have same exact issue... any solution to this?,YouTube
3295,it might have a faulty battery problem as it was found in a dozen of them. you should take it to an apple store.,YouTube
3296,You get what you pay for.,YouTube
3297,"I’ve had this exact problem on the same exact part of the display and chassis on iphone 6, 6s, and 7. For whatever reason, apple struggles making the device flush at that exact spot.",YouTube
3298,"the new iphone 8 has numerous factory defects, this is just one of them :[",YouTube
3299,I swear...ur dropped it.,YouTube
3300,"Even I thought it was designed that way, because mine had that 'lift' all around at the front; which was funny because the back was flush. Haven't still gotten around to checking the display models at the apple store.",YouTube
3301,"its shocking the quality,feel for the customers who buy it,and that goes for all companies.This should never happen,hope you get it sorted and they don`t start handling you.",YouTube
3302,Just read this morning that others are having the same problem...all over the world on the plus models.  The screen is lifting...they think it's a glue problem but it's definitely a problem along with buzzing/crackling sounds on the audio during phone calls.,YouTube
3303,Sucks to suck boiiiiiii no issues whatsoever here m80,YouTube
3304,My Samsung galaxy s8 liked the video on its own and laughed evilly,YouTube
3305,Note 7 curse strikes Apple,YouTube

3309,"IVE COIN THE NEW PHRASE! ""IPHANS"". LOL",YouTube
3310,that's what they get for laughing at Samsung last year with the note 7 ;),YouTube
3311,When the incident happened to Samsung and the note 7 even the main news channels got involved to slag Samsung off and put them down. I've not heard one thing accept on this channel about this. Talk about one sided... Spread spread spread quickly....,YouTube
3312,??????It's not the first for apple either. Apple paid big bucks???in hush money not long ago when some of their phones did explode. That's why not many of us heard about it??? https://youtu.be/o-nDrPjSAFc,YouTube
3313,Why do I have an urge to laugh...a lot?! ? I wasn't laughing this time last year! I should be super sympathetic......,YouTube

3317,Hi. I took my niece into the Apple store today cause the screen lifted on her IPhone 7plus. Apple Tec checked it and told us due to the battery expanding it lifted the screen. So they gave her a New 1.,YouTube

3327,Samsung Galaxy Note 8 ftw!,YouTube
3328,"Interestingly, Apple is using ATL, the company Samsung fired because they couldn't meet the safety compliance required by Samsung for the S8 and Note8.

3368,Well said,YouTube
3369,What have the trees done Matt?,YouTube
3370,THE MOST HONEST REACTION ON IPHONE 8 I HAVE EVER SEEN. WOW!!,YouTube
3371,I wouldn't even dream of changing from android to Apple if they paid me to. That's how strongly I feel for Android. And the pixel 2 will be a definite game changer.,YouTube
3372,"Don't buy the iPhone 8.... *at the end of the video* I gotta go, gonna pre order the iPhone 8....  Logic? Lolz XD  BTW cool glasses, you look like a bad boy Matthew",YouTube
3373,"I think the iphone 8 is the real ""iphone"" for 2017. The iphone X only exist because of the 10 year anniversary hype. I think the real iphone X will be released next year with better face id and probably with touch id.",YouTube
3374,"I agree completely, All the Iphone 8 line is, is a 7s and 7s+.",YouTube
3375,Nice video.,YouTube
3376,"yall gotta stop with these "" do not buy"" videos it's annoying",YouTube
3377,"I loved every second of this video! Honest, frank and to the point! That blog style conversation is just perfect. I encourage more of these Matt!",YouTube
3378,Totaly agree,YouTube
3379,I completely concur but if they had kept the aluminum body like the 6 and 7 not a single 8 would be sold.,YouTube
3380,Don't take advice from someone who wears Jhorts.,YouTube
3381,"I totally agree iphone 8 is actually an iphone 7s, as its same old body design, just a model trick. But A11 is the real deal ;p",YouTube
3382,"Totally Disagree like many others many see the better value in the 8/8 Plus as it is very similar in features to the iPhone X your only really losing the new screen and the 'slow' face scanner. We must remember that the X is a first gen product and that I recommend that you either join the iPhone Upgrade Program and get the 8/8 Plus and then after 12 months get the next gen of the X much better value in this idea and you don't lose Touch ID or miss out on any of the major features of the X such as wireless charging, better cameras, and A11 chip.",YouTube
3383,"You are really brave for coming out and just saying ur mind. You do know that there are people who will flame for giving such hate to Apple (which is IMO warranted) but you did it regardless. Honest content may not benefit the presenter, but it will benefit consumers. Well done keep it up and be brave :)",YouTube
3384,Videos getting better!,YouTube
3385,Apple did not impress me this year! iPhone 10 is not great. The notch throws off the design. OLED is not new technology. I get tired of apple selling its customers on a new function then getting rid of it after a few iterations saying they have something better. If it's not broke then don't try to fix it. If it works well then improve on it. Don't ditch it. #headphonejack #homebutton,YouTube
3386,Excellent job on this video!,YouTube
3387,Can't trust anyone in Jorts.,YouTube
3388,My favorite video you've ever made!!! Bahahahaha. I do agree with you except for the pre ordering a iPhone 8,YouTube

3391,"Totally ""d'accord avec vous!""",YouTube
3392,At least it doesn't look as bad as the S8.  Come at me haters,YouTube
3393,"I agree. Apple is losing it's magic and has been for a few years now. I think Apple's last best phone is the SE. The only reason why I think people have be stuck with Apple for a long time is because of popularity, ecosystem, and software. Android is good but it's too cluttered for something to really take Apple's crown away. I'm pretty sure that if someone comes up with something completely new and innovative that can appeal to the masses, plus market in creative ways how Apple has done in the past, then Apple is done for.",YouTube
3394,"I'm an apple Fan. I had  iPhone since iphone 4. But.. I think the 8 and 8 plus does not worth it. Myeaa.. maybe 8 plus if you have 6,6s or older is it worth. But iphone 8, with 4.7"" display , and only HD... Dude.. we're in 2017.Standard is 5.2""+. Samsung is in front of apple with 3-4 years .  But if you want to buy 8 and 8 plus you should really consider Samsung galaxy s8 Plus. :)",YouTube
3395,"Honestly one of the coolest and most interesting 'thoughts' videos I've seen. And yes, I agree.",YouTube
3396,I had to Google this guy to make sure that he wasn't the one who played Trevor in GTA 5.,YouTube
3397,Dude quit destroying the plants for no reason...bezzeles is over rated. Looks aren't everything. I like a little bezel.,YouTube
3398,"Great and straight forward,  as always like button smashed!",YouTube
3399,"I like apple products but going over $1000 for a cell phone, thats to much, I going to keep my 7+ for a long time unless Pixel is coming on affordable price, if not, time to move to another brand and of course android.",YouTube
3400,"Apple will soon see their demise like what happened to BlackBerry and Nokia, and apple will soon struggle with slow sales year over year less people buying iphones, remember years ago when people use to line up at apples stores to camp out for days and lines were huge. that doesn't happen anymore. lines are getting smaller and smaller. people aren't camping out anymore and people are slowly realizing iphones aren't hip anymore and realizing android manufactures are the ones innovating more",YouTube
3401,"I agree with you Matthew, I'll hang with my iphone 6s for 2 years probably.",YouTube
3402,The most honest review ??,YouTube
3403,I choce the iPhone 8 plus over a Galaxy s8 x),YouTube
3404,He looks like kenny from the walking dead,YouTube
3405,Awesome Concept Bro  #OneOfYourFan  @YashTech,YouTube
3406,But I love the iPhone 8 my favourite part is the headphone jack lol,YouTube
3407,10/10 video. Really. Bravo from Paris,YouTube
3408,Well i have a 5s and it’s not my money so might as well get the 8s plus,YouTube
3409,"I agree, I have a iPhone 6s Plus I am hanging with it until it’s  dead because I don’t see a big difference in 8 or 8 plus and to tell you the truth I think I will be getting a 7 plus instead, or I mite go back to Android Note 8?",YouTube
3410,"Fanny at the end,going to preorder iPhone 8!",YouTube
3411,What about android guys wanting to switch to iOS???,YouTube
3412,"Yes, yes, yes. Everything you point out is correct IMHO.  6s--headphone jack--fast fingerprint reader--fast camera--3D touch--affordable--bravo",YouTube
3413,Honest real review. I think the dislikes on this video are from mad illogical apple lovers who only love that logo and never know about phones.,YouTube
3414,"I think Apple kept IPhone 8 cause they don't wanna lose customers who prefer more traditional phone. I just don't like phones with bezels after holding and using G6 for a  while. My LG V20, HTC 10 and OnePlus 5 looks completely outdated in front of G6. I know some ppl still prefer flat screen and phone with crazy bezels. Apple is trying to keep everyone ? IPhone X is the most featured packed iPhone ever. Apple has change their philosophy and given something awesome! in the form of IPhone X to all loyal Apple consumers. The fact is IPhone is more like a Status Symbol and ppl are used to Apple eco system, so iPhone users gonna  buy it irrespective of specs & price. Atleast this time around they will be getting more futuristic and feature packed IPhone X?which is a good thing. Isn't it.",YouTube
3415,"Its 400$ cheaper, it doesnt have the same display of the X, but the internal and the camera features are the same . I think is better  getting the iPhone 8 plus instead of the X",YouTube
3416,2:02 ahahahahahahah,YouTube
3417,Amazing Words.? Honest as Hell?,YouTube
3418,If the iPhone X is the future of apple design I feel sorry for them!. Have you seen that notch on the top?? It hurts my eyes every time I see that thing!,YouTube
3419,love my 7 plus matte black,YouTube
3420,iPhone 5 SE is the best iphone of all time. ??,YouTube
3421,"Very well explained. We need more people like you who can put some sense into the world. These phones are things. We ought to be sentimental about people, our friends, and family. Not things.",YouTube
3422,You're Absolutely Right!!!,YouTube
3423,if we going by the way then what's the point of buying an iphone period? get an Lg or samsung... or get a budget phone. most people who have a new iphone won't upgrade but the people who have never had a iphone or need a upgrade may pick it up. since the iphone 6 there hasn't been an actual upgrade,YouTube
3424,"I think if someone is buying a new iPhone now and they can't/don't want the X, the 8 may be a better buy. Yeah it's 150$ more but you get double the storage and down the road in 2-3 years the A11 to A10 differences will start to show. AR, True Tone, wireless charging, louder speakers. It could be worth it.",YouTube
3425,"I mean, the 8 is worth it more than the X is. Fingerprint sensor, actual rectangle display, and the same chip/camera.",YouTube
3426,"I have an iPhone 6s and I'm going to buy an 8 plus. From my perspective, the 8 plus is a big upgrade, much better camera sensor and zoom sensor, better screen, much faster and future proof CPU/GPU, better battery, better speaker quality and 2 speakers instead of 1, wireless charging, better wifi, Bluetooth and cellular radios, waterproof and a bunch of other minor improvements. I've had my 6s for two years now so it is starting to get a little old. The battery life is still pretty good and easily lasts me a normal day of usage unless I use it heaps like on a rainy weekend or something and I've always bought a new phone every 2 years. I find 2 years is the best balance between resale price and new features. I like the X but I'm not willing to pay that much and I don't want to be a guinea pig for the new face ID etc. I'm happy to buy the 8 plus and get the 2nd or 3rd gen iPhone X.",YouTube
3427,I agree with you. If you have a 7 or plus just stick with it. If your 2 years overdue it's really up to you if you want to upgrade. I have a 6 and I always wait 2 years until I upgrade to a new phone.,YouTube
3428,"You know, I really like the iPhone 8 more. The iPhone X is definitely revolutionary with that design, but operating that thing is just dumb in my eyes. I rather press buttons than swiping all over my display. And the 8 may have worse cameras, but give iPhones a manual mode and they're the best shooters on the planet. If I had to choose, I would get the iPhone 8 Plus.",YouTube
3429,I want gta v! Please gimme steam key! PLEASE!!!!,YouTube
3430,The tree and the flannel. Papa scarce would be proud,YouTube
3431,I have an old iPhone 6 with a broken replacement screen (it looks like 360p display now) Plus my upgrade is due so I am justified to buy an iPhone 8. I don’t mind the bezels. To me the white bezels make the display stand out and the black bezels make it look like it isn’t there. I’ll stay with Apple for now but next time I might upgrade to Android with its the time is right(maybe pixel or Samsung). I’m not gonna get the iPhone 10 too Xpensive. I might buy the 7 or 8. The Plus is meh and big I can handle the 720-50p display especially if I can’t see whats wrong with it. Thanks for reading.,YouTube
3432,3:24 ??,YouTube
3433,Dang bitch I really thought you had the phone dang.... proved me wrong but it’s ok I guess I still like and subscribe so it’s whatever,YouTube
3434,"What if I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 and regret switching to it everyday, and cannot wait to go back to iPhone?",YouTube
3435,"I have an iPhone 6s and I am thinking about an upgrade, because the 6s I have is pretty old. But my problem is, in Germany the 7 Plus with 128 gb costs 890€ and the 8 plus with 64 gb costs 909€ and I know that 64 gb will be enough for me, because I lived with 16 gb for more than 2 years. But I don’t want 32 gb because i would like to film in better quality and things like that. But I know I will not need more than 64 gb..  So I should go with the iPhone 8 plus shouldn’t I?",YouTube
3436,Honestly speaking the only difference between the iPhone 10 and the iPhone 8 are three things.  Ois in both cameras the new display and face ID,YouTube
3437,"The iPhone 10 has a bezel, a weird looking cut out that will always be  in the videos you watch full screen (the camera cut-out) . What a odd decision from Apple.",YouTube
3438,Agreed,YouTube
3439,Couldn't have said it better!,YouTube
3440,I totally agree but I also don't like The I phone 10 ??,YouTube
3441,Agreed,YouTube
3442,"After watching this,  I'm gonna go order iPhone 8 in Space Gray 64GB",YouTube
3443,All iPhones=waste of money,YouTube
3444,How about phones don't need to be changed yearly or even after 2 years....this is nonsense  My iPhone 5s should last me 3-4 years at least,YouTube
3445,"For normal people, non-teens or reviewers, those who upgrade every 3 years or more, they are upgrading from the iphone 6 PLUS and here are a few things you will gain: 1 - 300% more RAM 2 - Many times better performance. 3 - Dual cameras 4 - Stereo speakers 5 - Force Touch 6 - Bluetooth 5 7 - Faster LTE and wifi 8 - faster storage 9 - superior front and rear cameras 10 - Higher capacity base model storage 11 - Water resistance 12 - Wireless charging 13 - Faster charging 14 - faster fingerprint sensor with haptic engine So the average user has good reason to upgrade, in fact it will be a massive improvement. So videos like this are rather dumb as it is obvious if you have an iphone 7 plus then an upgrade will be a minor step up, but for real-world users it's a great upgrade, but of course, the irony of it is, if the iPhone 8 had an infinity display, this reviewer would be saying how it is worth upgrading from the 7!!! What a strange world we live in!",YouTube
3446,"I actually love the old school look of iphones 6plus and 7plus,and I miss bezels :(. Im using pretty s7 edge,which is amazing,but after seeing that gold 8 plus,I gotta have it. And it will be nice to have iPhone for a change,and bezels..cant wait to get bezels again :(. As far as design with no bezels goes,Samsung won that game aaages ago. Still,s8plus has the most amazing camera. For me,its worth switching. Did I say its beautiful creme gold? XD",YouTube
3447,"haha loved it Matt.... ""1000bucks hits fence?????""",YouTube
3448,We do what you tell us moniz. Can i eat today? Thank you.,YouTube

3455,Spot on,YouTube
3456,"Wow, you cant half whinge !  What a load of crap.  And to answer your question, NO you should never talk again.  What an apple hater !  How much did Samsung pay you to make this video !  PMSL",YouTube
3457,You don’t like the iPhone 8 but I do,YouTube
3458,"I’m still using an iPhone 6 Plus THE iPHONE 8 PLUS IS A HUGE UPGRADE, FIGHT ME",YouTube
3459,2:02 LOL,YouTube
3460,Too bad I already got an iPhone 8 Plus I came from a 3GS,YouTube
3461,"The problem with Iphone X that it's a prototype it was not ready for the release,but apple had no choice,because samsung and other companies are beating the hell out of apple.So they had no choice but to release unfinished Iphone X.",YouTube
3462,"you're a bird, and if apples behind look at there stock price.",YouTube
3463,This guy is right the iphone 8 is the internally better version of the 7 but some ppl dont care bout that.. They care that its the newest phone,YouTube
3464,"And here we go. The moment of SILENCE! why? weeeellll. Because the crApple supporters jammed us in a corner with our Note 7 battery issue. Now the tables have turned ten-fold. Why is this funny you ask? because our Note 7 didn't cost $1k, like these overpriced ""1st gen"" products apple claims to revolutionize technology with. So, in conclusion, I am laughing my butt off as pleasantly as humanly possible. #TeamGalaxy",YouTube
3465,More anti apple videos,YouTube
3466,I'm also always swelling when I see Chinese women...,YouTube
3467,2 minutes into the vid and I'm already dying of laughter this dudes impressions are too funny ??? and the cat meowing was icing on the cake ??,YouTube
3468,The whole “don’t leave your phone on the charger overnight” has been proven wrong over and over.........,YouTube
3469,They are just holding their phones wrong.,YouTube
3470,Try doing a collaborative video with that isheep Tailosive Tech. ? It would be fun,YouTube
3471,I'm just waiting for it to reach a scale at which the iphone 8 will get banned from planes and airports,YouTube
3472,I love your cat,YouTube
3473,Welcome back to the Note 7 exploding battery debacle (don't be surprised if this iPhone gets banned from various transportation),YouTube
3474,One can only hope more IPhone battery  problems occur!,YouTube

3478,Will Apple burn to the ground???,YouTube
3479,Nice intro,YouTube
3480,Lol kitty!!!,YouTube
3481,"Of course this won't be all over hyped like the Note 7 battery issue by those tech sites, journalists and bloggers. Oh no, Apple will not be smeared by those due to their tongues firmly in Apple's butthole. Apple won't also give a flying fig about their consumers either.",YouTube
3482,Ha!  What!?!?!  I've been in that bar! (90% certain).  #frightened,YouTube
3483,Subscribed. Give 'em hell!,YouTube
3484,live stream was really fun man thanks?,YouTube
3485,"Apple will fix this with a software update, so no need to return your exploded phone",YouTube
3486,Apple is in a whole different position they can't recall because the galaxy line had a major release early in the year with the s7 and s7 edge and had options for consumers and had phones coming out a few months later apple would be screwed til next year because the iphone 10 sales would suffer,YouTube
3487,Apple copying Samsung AGAIN!,YouTube
3488,Karma at its finest,YouTube
3489,"I've always said to people that by buying the iPhone's directly from the Apple Store they will get problems.. try buying them from other retailers like EE, 02, Vodafone and they will NOT get the issues... that was a Pattern I have sussed out!!",YouTube
3490,Maybe apple wants the iPhone 8 to be banned from planes and etc to make people have no choice but to get the iPhoneX,YouTube
3491,"This was just about a non issue. Unlike the billions of $$$ Samsung lost on the Note 7. They didn’t have enough humility to admit there was a problem, THERE WAS A PROBLEM!!! They had to admit it. And it wasn’t a teeny tiny problem.",YouTube
3492,its true apple sucks. I just called my local airport and demanded the airline ban iPhone 8 just like the note 7 haha crapple blows goats!!!,YouTube

3498,"i think explosion was caused by software issue, i am sure that apple will fix the problem soon as they did it with headphone background noise, i hope that apple's death will be way sooner than i expect",YouTube
3499,and apple was making fun of samsung,YouTube

3505,"Here is a thought for your videos. Its clear you are a trekkie like myself and I wondered if you you might consider using a background sound to your videos. Something, perhaps like this...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feoUzNRzAxg. I watched this video again with it running in the background and it seemed to work well.",YouTube
3506,Apple is a JOKE,YouTube

3523,i want anti apple vids to see your cat and to watch you making fun of companies. apple if you dont hate other (there is so much to say about apple) make fun of apple fanboys. you already have them as enemies but it may bring you subs from the andro guys,YouTube
3524,"If you ever reached a point on YouTube where you can quit your current job, would you?",YouTube
3525,Apple would def lose at least 35% of their customers if Android had a universal iMessage and face time equivalent.,YouTube
3526,"Yes, I watched your video again. Even though you are often times wrong it's still entertaining to watch. ;)",YouTube
3527,Eedjit. There’s a difference between actual fire/explosion and swelling causing a tightly packed phone to break apart. I’m not a big Apple fan these days but you have real issues with them fair play. Great free advertising for Apple though as that’s all you seem to talk about,YouTube
3528,Thank you for being very unlike Apple by providing viewers the option to skip to the main content by showing the time to forward to. The way you're thinking is showing that you're a true android users and fan.,YouTube

3587,You need to check your emails.,YouTube
3588,"Auto lock to never hmm, not a good idea for everyone. I wouldn’t “tell” people to set it to never. You may not forget to turn off your display Brandon but other people won’t remember this now their display is just burning eating away at battery life with auto brightness off as you also told them and the display set as bright as it can go not to mention the people that walk away from their phone at work, home, etc...leaving their device vulnerable to prying eyes ?.",YouTube

Also LMAO Samsung's probably purposely delaying the supply for apples screen so that they can start up earlier xD,YouTube
3733,You do know most of these headlines are either faked or exaggerated. not defending apple in any way but im just saying that is how the media works. dont believe everything out there and just be patient if you want to know how the iphone will look like/be like etc,YouTube

3852,Get iOS 11.1 Instead. Way better battery life across iPhones.,YouTube
3853,Better then everything apple pro,YouTube
3854,What about iPod 6,YouTube
3855,WARNING! Don’t update your iPhone to iOS 11.0.1 or IOS 11.0.2 because when your phone hits 15%-20% Battery it already turns off and it says there is no battery (no charge) *Btw I use iPhone 7 Plus*  I’m not begging for likes but its better to like this comment so people will not update to iOS 11.0.1 or iOS 11.0.2,YouTube
3856,Is there any benefits to the 7 plus with 11.0.2?,YouTube
3857,I believe Apple have solution for that bug issue. Not like android.,YouTube

3866,My iPhone stuck too much after update to ios 11,YouTube
3867,Lol fast charging is bug atm... just normal charge it,YouTube
3868,That's why I don't do iOS updates on my phone.,YouTube
3869,"they will probably advise that battery takes time to readjust to new ios and it will get to normal after awhile, after awhile like few months later, you realized its still behaving the same, this time they will advise that it is completely normal for a battery to drain faster after months of using and probably give you some advise on battery saving tips by shutting off most of the settings just to sustain another few minutes longer, finally your warranty is out, they will advise that your phone is old, you should go for newer model instead.. same cycle repeat",YouTube
3870,Had almost the same problem as you but worse. iPhone 8 got stuck in boot loop and was always on 1% charge. I was able to fix it by DFU-restoring it,YouTube

3880,Android >>> iOS.,YouTube

3963,It is because of reviewers like you that companies think they can get away with providing mediocre battery life. You got one day battery life and you say “I’m impressed!”. I know that for some reason you value fast charging more than battery on a single charge but come on Ranjit Bhai show some spine and criticise what needs to be criticised. Please realise that you guys are influencers but it seems like you guys have just settled for one day battery life.,YouTube

3977,"A11 is 10nm processor so naturally it is way more power efficient, density always helps in processors, we saw this with SD 625 which was Qualcomm's first 14nm processor. Also, in your unboxing you mentioned that A11 has 6 cores, 4 of which are high performance and 2 are high efficiency cores, but it is actually reverse of it, only 2 are high perf cores. As for you noticing UI lag, it is probably because you've been using that 120hz screen of iPad Pro all the time. On my 3 years old iPad Air 2, upgrading from iOS 10 to 11 has made battery life and overall performance much better. :)",YouTube

And i will have to transfer the data from fone to laptop/pc frequently.  On the other hand 102000Rs is a huge amount to invest in a fone... I mean a fone for 1 lac. Thats tooo much...

4048,Different year same story. Are we zombies?,YouTube
4049,"The instant that iOS 11 was installed on my iPhone 7, battery performance dropped substantially and the device tends to run hot. I was able to reduce the impact by removing some of the processes from the new Notification panel. This update was one of the least seamless and most disruptive of any and I've been an iPhone user since its first generation. Visual Voicemail broke, my personal ringers broke, my iCloud logins broke, and a number of settings were radically altered. Most issues were easy to address and fix but I don't remember ever having such a rough update. Even the jump to iOS 10, with big UI and aesthetic changes, was technologically a much smoother more elegant transition.",YouTube

4218,"I myself have owned every iPhone from 4 onwards till the 7. Didn't like ios 11 and didn't like the iPhone X. Bought a galaxy s8 after the iPhone Launch. I still remember Steve Jobs saying ""we don't ship junk to our customers ""... What a sad day indeed",YouTube
4219,They have never been bold in my opinion.,YouTube
4220,"I can't agree with everything on this video, i do see that this is made on September 15 so i don't know if you still feel this way, but i had the iPhone 5 and 6S plus and now have the iPhone X and it works like a charm! Really good phone, love the new gestures and it really is natural to be honest. Very fast even. :-)",YouTube

4222,Very thoughtful video. Very nicely pointed out the core facts. Though am always been an android user and am really really enjoying my samsung galaxy s8 plus and have no plans to step into Apple's trap but i hope your video will help all those apple fan boys think twice before they make the greatest mistake of purchasing apple 8 or 8 plus or the apple x,YouTube
4223,"You're right, thats why im going to get the galaxy note 8. .",YouTube

4228,"i had purchased iphone 4 when it launched brought iphone 6 a few weeks ago , i wll buy the X after 3 years  any new launch is just incremental and overpriced , if u wish to feel a huge difference just wait 3-4  years before  changing phones",YouTube
4229,U mean Apple picking?,YouTube
4230,"Thing about Apple is.... They make old tech sound new, like you said but that being said, we should be glad, its the most popular smartphone on the planet. Now that Apple followed QI Standard and adopted the wireless charging feature, more companies will want to include that, more starbucks chains would include wireless charging pads, IKEA would add that feature into more of their furniture, and the possibilities are endless, when Apple releases something, it becomes big, its almost as good as reinventing it. just like Touch ID, sure there were plenty of phones with a fingerprint sensor, but when Apple released it, they did it good enough to the point where it becomes a standard in almost every smartphone today. Apple's sure as hell not innovative, not in many ways at least but they are a huge influence to the market, wireless charging didnt take off as intended when samsung adopted it, just wait a year and it'll become a standard everywhere! but of course everyone's entitled to their own opinions. Great video tho",YouTube
4231,"Hi everything this guy has said is spot on , I too would not buy an iPhone 10 even though I have all the apple gear to date , when I see Tim Cook perform at the apple keynote event ‘ I see a guy looking for a grade 1 mug . And for that reason I shall wait for a new an honest devise to enter the tech market,  Steve jobs was the man ‘ and mr cook  I’m afraid that you never were or ever could be anyone like the great Steve jobs ?",YouTube
4232,"Your right and on top of that each product besides the Apple TV had issues of one sort or another, But also when the X comes out how will it really work in the real world usage and that's after the delays. With the other companies on par with the same or better features at the same sort of price point you have more choice than ever and not locked into one phone only. Like you said the other companies is the real innovators with tried and tested features and pushing the boundary further where it's is Apples first line to include this on the X.",YouTube
4233,Then go for Android phones. I recommend LG V30 / G6. That simple!,YouTube
4234,"I like how they dedicated those hardware for face I’d, but don’t take away the home button. Let people choose which one to use. But iphone 8 is a joke, how old is that design, 3 years? Funny how apply said it is an all new design lol",YouTube
4235,It's just a phone with cameras.,YouTube
4236,Who surfs in safari in landscape mode please!!!,YouTube
4237,"Apple sucks  Pay more money to get less technology. Apple never invent anything they just copy Samsung and polished them and give it to customer. In new models they say they are giving true tone display which was invented by Samsung 5 years ago in S3 MODEL as ""auto brightness"".  I am ANDROID fan but I don't know why I ordered iPhone 8 plus and now they are not cancelling my order. WHY!!!  APPLE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!",YouTube
4238,As an Android developer in an apple shop I am really disappointed with how Apple isn't even trying to be clever about they're guerrilla marketing and resting upon their laurels to do the dirty work. The operating system is buggy and limited (unlike the open source distro it's based upon) they've been slacking while other companies have been pushing the limits of what can be done on a mobile device. Honestly it makes me sad that the state of the industry has sunk this low. GNU ftw!,YouTube
4239,Well said bro... I myself had ditch apple after the iphone8 and x keynote and bought a Samsung Sexy8. Nothing revolutionary about apple product anymore after Steve Job is gone.,YouTube
4240,"The face ID failed because it worked the way it was designed to, when they setup to demo before the keynote to workers that set it up didn’t realize the phone was trying to identify their face, like the was Touch ID locks out if someone else tries to use it. Also, you keep saying you’re tired to the iPhone being the same thing over and over, but when the take a leap and do something new you say it’s terrible. I do agree that it’s awkward now, but it’s a transition and in time it will be normal",YouTube
4241,Funny that my lowly LG V20 that cost me all of $350 has more ppi than this overpriced paperweight.,YouTube
4242,"Yes Apple is starting to frustrate me, and yes I really miss Mr. Jobs, but I can’t figure out how so many people are downing the IPhone X, and it hasn’t even come out yet, none of these people got the phone in there hand, no none of these Samsung lovers, apple hater have even touched the IPhone X so what’s with the negativity, yes Samsung finally got ahead of the game for the last four years, and yes IPhone is playing a little catch up, but in the end a phone is a phone and the difference between the two is sort of minimum if we really think about it. So if you like Samsung buy Samsung, and if you like Apple buy Apple. Let’s grow up and stop all this, I mean the automobile really hasn’t changed much in the last 40 years, but you don’t see hordes of people talking about how ford need to catch up with Chrysler or how a Tesla electric car is so much better than a Chevy volt( ok maybe it is). People just buy what they want and what they can afford end of story",YouTube
4243,Apple is fucking lazy apple tried to put figerprinrt scanner under the display but failed so apple decided to remove and apple should change the design first iphone 7 and iphon 8 is exactly the same unless apple changed metal to glass but that is not real reason iphone X and 8 EXTREMELY  expensive i recommended  you guys that don't upgrade to iphone 8 finally apple just get aids fucking dickhead,YouTube
4244,"I too have had every single iPhone since the 4s up to the 7plus. I got tired of blindly being an apple fanboy, when the quality of the product has diminished ! The final straw was when I purchase my 15 inch MacBook Pro two months ago, which is absolutely subpar to my  4 year old 15 inch MacBook Pro. The main culprit is the completely oversized and in-the-way trackpad. Finally, I decided that I was going to try the Note 8, I made the purchase with pains in my stomach, for fear of leaving my comfort zone. Well, after my purchase, I was completely disgusted and ready to return the phone three days in because it was such a different feel, but on the fourth night, after i broke through the learning curve of changing from IOS to Android , I fell in love! Are there  things that I miss from the iPhone ? Absolutely! But the change was long over due and very well worth it! The things i miss I are very minimal at best.  The Note 8 is by far the best phone I have touched in the last 5 years! I have never loved any of my iPhones the way I love this phone. I have so many more options to make it  match my personality, and to be honest, Android actually feels better than IOS 11 to me.",YouTube
4245,"??Apple must really think we're that stupid enough 2 buy into this sh**!!!!!..yet again.

4401,"PLEASE READ:  ""Oh well,"" they say, ""it's not that bad. You just have to get used to it."" No, you do not HAVE to get used to it, and no, you do not HAVE to buy the new iPhone. Can nobody see that this is precisely what Apple Inc. wants us to do? They want the mindless masses to accept whatever they do, to follow them blindly, to accept their decisions no matter what. But, as Benjamin Franklin once wrote, ""If you make yourself a Sheep, the Wolves will eat you."" Perhaps people will never cease to pursue the pretentious vogue these products hold, but I urge you to think for a moment. Ask yourself why you are following trends and holding yourself to man-made standards. Are you doing it because you really think it's best, or are you falling blindly for corporate mind-tricks? If you've read this far, I won't lecture you much longer. I really appreciate your willingness to hear what I have to say. I hope you will consider my opinion and have a wonderful day. .",YouTube

I returned it for an s8 plus which is highly advance and on point. And guess what  I had some money back which i used for ps4 and a day trip all for the same price as an iphone x. The other stupid           Thing I heard is there is no home button so when the phone freezez your fucked. And don't make me start on the notch I might aswell have a dildo sticking out of the phone.  The face recognition is the slow  and for all that you pay 1k. Only fools who don't understand technology buy this phone.

I would like more features that are exclusive to the phone for the software. If Apple can add these things to the next phone then it will be the best!

Who are ok with it, finds doesn’t bother at all: They got the iPhone X and experienced it.   TBH though .. I hated the notch and thought it was stupid at the time of iPhone event.

While I think they've done a decent job (and will only improve) there are a few areas where it feels unintuitive and doesn't work that well.  For instance, getting to the ""Close apps"" view now requires two steps, and the assistive reach function is finnicky and only works 6/10 for me.",YouTube
4593,"Needed an upgrade from my battle proven 5s of 5 years. Went with the ten because it will age a bit better than the 8+(i hope) and i needed a reasonably sized device for my active lifestyle. The camera will be very much appreciated and the a11 bionic has me very excited. My phone had slowed down, lagged, had battery issues, and overall wasn't doing the job anymore. I am so excited to get my ten and dive into it, most people seem to only dislike the software and almost always say how powerful the hardware is, for this reason i am very optimistic it will be perfect for me.",YouTube

I take my phone out and swipe in one motion by the time the phone is in front of me im in .To his specific driving example when I'm in my car im holding the phone below the wheel I swipe first then glance at the phone and boom I'm in . So he wants to be able to accidentally hit buy button on an app and before he knows it the phone scans his face and now he has to call apple for refund. There has to be some mechanism to confirm a purchase this just ask you to hit the side button twice",YouTube
4615,"Yep, agree with everything. It'd have to be nearly perfect for a thousand bucks and it's clearly not. Not to mention stellar other options for way less money. It's definitely not worth it in my opinion. Switched from iPhone for long years to Android now and I'm pretty happy so far.",YouTube
4616,I have the same sentiments with the way iOS  handles the settings of the phone.  You'll have to dig just to turn off cellular data,YouTube
4617,"After researching quite a few reviews on the iPhone X and the Pixel 2 XL, it seems to me that Google has outdone Apple in the software department this go around.",YouTube
4618,I always thought that metal is a better quality than glass. More durable and has a cold premium feeling,YouTube
4619,I only know one person who has the X and I asked how they liked it and didn’t really get a positive response. Most people have the 7s and 8s.,YouTube
4620,I really want to switch to Samsung,YouTube
4621,Eyyyyy Those photos were taken in Portland :)!!!,YouTube
4622,im sorry but iphones suck ????,YouTube
4623,I am one of those Apple fans but I have to admit I do not like my iPhone X as much as I liked my iPhone 7 Plus. I hope they come out with a better one next year or I may be looking to go back to Android myself?.,YouTube
4624,Haha apple is dumb and dumber haha. For those apple slaves out there i pity on u. Dont believe what apple tells u. Dont be slaves.,YouTube
4625,"I'm using amoled displays since the s6, and ""Never"" had a problem with blue tint. It's Apples fine tuning wich creates the problem.",YouTube
4626,I’m a Note8 user but nothing and I repeat nothing in this video is a convincing argument for the iPhone X’s flaws.,YouTube
4627,More and more people seem to switching from Apple to Android...,YouTube
4628,"Finally someone is talking about that stupid  FaceID facial recognition...I don't like it at all, but I'm happy with iphone 7plus!!!",YouTube
4629,As an x iPhone user watching this from My Note 8 and thinking who the hell pays that much money to IPhone x when you can get a stunning Note 8.,YouTube
4630,For me they butchered this phone with that forehead. Big thumbs down! What were they thinking?,YouTube
4631,"I love the iPhone X, but I would rather have the LG G6, Galaxy s8, One Plus 5T, or the Pixel 2. I would get one as a secondary phone to use at the house, but I cannot justify the pricepoint. It truly is an amazing device, but they should have lowered the price and put touch ID in the apple logo on the back. For me it is Android>Apple.",YouTube
4632,"Made the switch to Android, much better.",YouTube
4633,Right on point.,YouTube
4634,Seems like everytime Apple makes you Upgrade iOS there is somthing that becomes harder to do. And another thing for the love of god Apple please stop asking me if I want to Upgrade iOS and then when you click no they take you to the upgrade agreement page. Plus they take features away like the AUX so youll buy the air pods. I mean it's business I guess but I'm an avid AUX user. The only thing holding me back from getting andiod is iMesage and Facetime.,YouTube
4635,"Most honest unbiased review, what's with the haters ? Oh yeah.. they probably bought already lol.",YouTube
4636,Good choice switching back! Phone ?,YouTube
4637,Wise decision. Just too bad the Pixel 2 XL has one of the worst displays I've seen on a smartphone.,YouTube
4638,YAAY JOIN THE LIGHT SIDE!,YouTube
4639,You can turn off the “blue tint” it’s called trutoned,YouTube
4640,"Great review. I love my iPhone X, but your observations on the software and settings are spot on. I don't mind losing the 'premium' design of the glass back because I always case & shield my phones. Subscribed & looking forward to hearing more of your reviews!",YouTube
4641,The double tap to download a app is not bad. I accidentally clicked on a app and if it wasn’t for that double tap I would have bought it. Your totally wrong about that feature,YouTube
4642,"1st world problem. lifting a damn phone is problem! for all i know, ill go with any phone that i like.",YouTube
4643,"It seems like with every feature the iPhone X has, there is a problem hahaha if the screen is good the notch ruins it. If the camera is good the front camera is not. If the design is good, it is slippery. If the software is fluent and we'll optimised, it is lacking of features.",YouTube
4644,I have watched a lot of reviews on the X. Your message in this one is spot on. Thumbs up,YouTube
4645,Go figure I can run 8 apps on screen on my s8,YouTube
4646,I bought the original Pixel XL amazing phone missing a few features. I went ahead and purchased the Pixel 2 XL and thought it was a perfect phone with the exception of the P-OLED LG display a horrible blue tint that I just couldn’t deal with. I know have an iPhone X while there are a few things I like on the iPhone there are many things I miss from my Pixel 2 XL however I will keep the iPhone until the Pixel 3 releases.,YouTube
4647,You didn't really explain why,YouTube
4648,"Very honest info and I agree with everything stated. I would buy a new iPhone every year for the past 4 years, this is the first year I skipped. I will stick to my iPhone 7 for now. Although IOS 11 does not function well on the 7 I have no choice and I have really been considering getting an android. My problem is most of my devices are all Apple and I have to much invested in Apple plus I love the Apple Watch",YouTube
4649,Remove the notch with the fingerprint scanner on the back? What about the front facing camera?,YouTube
4650,Face unlock is a joke. That alone would make me pass. What were they thinking?  1+ 5t double tap look it's open or use the rear fingerprint scanner.,YouTube
4651,"You said that Apple should've put a fingerprint sensor on the Apple logo to ""remove the notch to make room for more display"", but there's always going to be a notch, even if it's smaller as the front camera has to be included (Like the essential phone).",YouTube
4652,Oh guys don’t listen to anyone that has any google apps that replace the Apple apps and Anyone who demos with afresh install. This guy wishes the iPhone ran android.,YouTube
4653,"Left iPhone for XZ premium, over the moon with the choice.",YouTube
4654,Ha Ha 553?? Apple Fanboys ?,YouTube
4655,*THAT NOTCH!*,YouTube
4656,Note 8 and op5t still king,YouTube
4657,"There’s no reason to make a video, just do it, your decision is an opinion and everyone has one, what was the video supposed to be kinda like a Jedi mind trick, the world would see your video and everyone would start returning iPhone X’s, that only works on the weak minded.",YouTube
4658,iPhone X seems pretty terrible,YouTube
4659,"Question, does iOS have Smart Unlock like Android? It doesn't seem to have it, based on some of the comments in this review. Smart Unlock allows trusted (wifi and Bluetooh) devices and trusted locations to unlock the phone. So if you are in your car and connected to your car's stereo via Bluetooth, you shouldn't need to constantly unlock your phone. Smart Unlock will do it for you.",YouTube
4660,In my opinion the only phone that can justify $1000 price tag is the Note 8. But yeah iOS 11 is a bug fest. I fucking despise it on my iPad.,YouTube
4661,Useless pricey piece of junk. Call me when iphone will be able to transfer and play hi res flac files.,YouTube
4662,"you want an android,get it... why made a shitty review ios is different then android, respect that",YouTube
4663,would be cool to have android on that device,YouTube
4664,if u want widgets stick to android ?,YouTube
4665,"Disappointing review. You basically just go on about why iOS is iOS and not Android. Loved you content, but this is a such a disappointing review. If you want a burger go eat a burger, dont grab a pizza and cry why this isnt a burger. damn!",YouTube
4666,The iPhone X is shit,YouTube
4667,"I am android fanboy, but no one who buys 999$ phone, leave it for other unless you get money from it in some way.",YouTube
4668,"Good decision, you should use note 8",YouTube
4669,"Apple is a Scam.   First the Face is a piece of crap and it's reliability and consistency is only about 7/10. You have to always hold it to your face which is serious inconvenient if you wish to discreetly unlock the phone to check something.   Also the price they are charging is ludicrous. They think that it's OK to pay close to $1800 for a 64GB in Canada and well over $2000 for the 256GB. Why was the 128GB not an available option? Go figures, because most power users dont have enough storage with the 64GB and you are forced to fork out more cash in order to get the 256GB. Also, fast charging is not available and you have to spend like close to $80 for the fast charging adapter.  Also, their so called ""high-tech"" features were available in many android phones 2 years ago. As well as many flagship android phones cost about half the iPhone X, with same or better features and better screen.  Is the iPhone X twice as good as OnePlus 5, LG v30, or Google Pixel 2 XL, Samsung 8/Note 8 based on its price? I think not.  Now they are deliberating slowing down your old iphone 5/6/7 because they are ""to protect you and give you the best experience."" after they got busted with the iOS update of under clocking your phone's processor, without you knowing it or your consent, and after getting busted, they release some bullshit statement.  Only iSheeps will support this crap. They think it's OK to fork out 2k cash because it's an iphone. I will never support this scam of a company with shady business practices, and greed is their priority.",YouTube
4670,Nice review of the Galaxy s6....I mean iPhone X,YouTube
4671,"you don't need to wait for the unlock process. you pick the phone, swype up and it will faceid your face and it's unlocked.. so simple",YouTube
4672,"Honestly, I switched to iPhone last year with the 7+ and now I’m using the IPhone X. This phone is, hands down, the best phone I have ever used. This coming from a guy (me) who used android up until last year. The phone screams even with (only) 3 gigs of ram. The screen is beautiful. I’m getting as much screen, if not more, than a plus or  XL phone BUT in a package that is small enough to operate (mostly) with one hand. All you people out there... don’t knock the X until you have tried it yourself. I almost guarantee you will be sold the instant you pick it up.",YouTube
4673,"If Software is the problematic area of iphone x, as told by the reviewer, then with time it will improve (apple is generous with updates). Hardware has already been praised in the video. What is left then? Iphone x is my choice.",YouTube
4674,Dude you can change the Samsung screen saturation. You can't with apple,YouTube
4675,Enjoy movies in landscape with that huge notch. Lol,YouTube
4676,This channel has completely fallen off...unsubscribe bye,YouTube
4677,"I did the opposite. I chose the Samsung S8 and ended up going back to the iPhone X. With all of its issues, the iPhone X is a get it done device and it is more stable. I loved Samsung, but Android just felt unpolished. The iPhone may not have the customization capabilities, the iPhone is really built for business. My recommendation is to get the phone that works for you. As for battery life, I disagree with the reviewer. I use my phone hard and can easily go from 6am until 11 pm with battery to spare.",YouTube
4678,"I like your title, you attention seeker.  There is nothing wrong with the X, stop giving it so much hate.",YouTube
4679,the only ting I like about this phn is the camera that's it,YouTube
4680,I really dont care which phone is better if you like a phone then you should stick to that phone instead of arguing which is better!!!!,YouTube
4681,iPhone X is Great !!! I don’t know why you stating you own personal opinion on video where you constantly complaining about the IPhone X and things it can’t do cause your literally listing everything that android does main reason why Apple will always be better is because all Apple devices work and are compatible with each other unlike android,YouTube
4682,"Frankly, I think few if any would complain if there was an *iPhone X Plus* size. This phone is only a tad larger than the small iPhone 6-8, or a tad smaller than the LG V30. I warned my daughter it's smaller than her iPhone 6 Plus, so we'll see.",YouTube
4683,Awesome face ID test ?,YouTube
4684,Shaved for a review. Dedication. Deserves a like for that.,YouTube

4690,1000 really not woorth it,YouTube
4691,Why doesn’t anyone test face ID in the dark?????,YouTube
4692,What if a girl removed her makeup will the FACE ID still recognize her ???,YouTube
4693,"TBH iris is better. During winter, or for women living in Islamic countries, and many other occasions, we only show our eyes and not our full face. Face ID won't work.",YouTube
4694,This niggah so dedicated to his work that he shaved off his beard.,YouTube
4695,Not a big innovation leap like Apple says and definitely not worth 1000+ dollars.,YouTube
4696,Fail ID????,YouTube
4697,Dear Holy Ghost. Please don’t let other manufacturers copy the “the notch”. Thanks love ya,YouTube
4698,"Wait, so you still have to swipe up on the phone to get to the home screen after using the face ID? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of using a hands free unlock system?",YouTube
4699,"That notch is a disgrace, awful design. I wonder what Steve Jobs would have said!",YouTube
4700,I'll stay with my note 8 ? but good for Apple for stepping up there game,YouTube
4701,"That wasn’t a review, that was a “first impressions” video. Misrepresented YouTube tittle.",YouTube
4702,The Notch..?????.....,YouTube
4703,"hahahahahah FACE ID TEST ,, he is not even showing the unlocking..",YouTube
4704,"Most of that extra screen real estate you get with this phone goes completely unused throughout the UI........just tons of wasted space. This ""edge-to-edge"" screen trend is cool in all but until this aspect ratio issue is accommodated for in a better way than the wasted space or black bars on 2-3 corners of the screen when viewing 3rd party apps or video in landscape then these types of devices are purely just novelty.",YouTube
4705,face ID not Halloween friendly :(,YouTube
4706,No thanks that's why bought the iPhone 8+,YouTube
4707,I don't  think  Steve Jobs would  have approved that little notch thing.  It was little things like that  he was a stickler about.  You have to ask yourself --does  it add extra functionality  to the phone? Nope--just makes the screen  look fragmented. So why add it? To make  screen  look edge to edge?  It distorts the picture so that's why it sucks.,YouTube
4708,Does that stainless steel scratch like the old iPods?,YouTube
4709,I feel like I've stepped back 10 to 15 years when looking at that UI,YouTube
4710,"Saw Verge review they say it Face id doesnt unlock with the sun in the background and in dim lights like Deli shops. Also some apps are trimmed or cropped down so that the screen looks smaller than IPhone 8 plus. What are your thoughts about it. And how about the new advanced processor is it more powerful and fast than macbook pro. Also include comparison of camera between  iPhone 8plus, Pixel 2, Samsung s8 plus and Samsung note 8",YouTube
4711,"This is not a review , it is advertisement . I will stay with my Iphone 7 for a while .",YouTube
4712,great review. I switched to android 5 years ago. good to see i'm still not missing out on anything,YouTube

4737,Notch and the side bezels are still too big.,YouTube
4738,Emoji? Unlock with face ID but you still need to swipe up... There was nothing wrong with touch ID. I'd rather have a home button than that stupid notch.. Nah Apple. Keep it,YouTube

4742,I hope the iPhone XS will have Touch ID in the screen.,YouTube
4743,Think ill keep my 8 plus! Im perfectly happy with it!,YouTube
4744,Almost all Android phones have face recognition. The facial recognition recognizes your face even when your lower part of your face is covered. So even if you grow a beard it will recognize your face. Even if you try to hide your face it will recognize it. The face Id is just a copy of Android. It's even slower than Android. The only advantage face id has over Android is low light unlocking.,YouTube
4745,"Phone is just not friendly and easier to use but more complicated...  Just not a good and easy to use product. And face ID and swipe up, no thanks",YouTube
4746,bias review does not actually show if phone is unlock or not..  Instead doing some cut scene and showing thumb up and down...  If you want unbias review..  Go watch Verge,YouTube
4747,Colossal waste of money,YouTube
4748,"X is such a piece of shit still reviewrs can't stop talking about it as something legendary , this seems really skewed up. Reviewrs should really instead tell their viewers to not waste money on a such expensive device which makes not much difference and takes some steps back in many respects. I believe 1000 dollars are so less valuable and can't even change a single poor person's life!",YouTube

4751,Galaxy S8 better.,YouTube

4761,Every one is holding the phone to their face to unlock. An actual world use would be for the phone to unlock while looking down at it as you bring it out from your pocket.,YouTube
4762,"Honestly nothing about the new iPhone X seems to wow me enough to want to upgrade it it. I honestly may switch back to android as I’ve gone back and forth between the two. The X just doesn’t have too many new or exciting enough features for me to justify spending a grand on it. I don’t know, I’ll wait and see, but so far I’m pretty “meh” about the whole thing.

But without the notch... you would not know which is really the top of the phone(until you fumble with the buttons on the side and realize the phone is upside down.)  Notch helps realize where top of phone is. Just like the older bottom button on older phones, was visual clue to bottom of phone.  And notch does not bother my view at all.

4830,Everyone I urge you not to buy this phone and save your money Samsung makes apples screens now and Samsung has a wide variety of issues with pink lines and green lines across their displays and early models of the Apple phones have been displaying the same exact defects. Google Samsung pink line and you will expect to see the same issue on the Apple except it will be green also the iPhone x.. Also these are already having problems and cold weather,YouTube
4831,Ign showing off their app that isnt optimized for the X yet. Lol,YouTube
4832,They said top notch lol savage,YouTube
4833,1000 plus tax,YouTube
4834,Your reviews are pathetic ign,YouTube
4835,ANDROID WINS ANYWAY!!!,YouTube
4836,This phone is trash :/,YouTube
4837,"Why people would buy this is beyond me. Half of the ""new"" features have been around for androids for years. You can't even add memory. Nice phone but for 1k definitely not worth it.",YouTube
4838,Rather have a Galaxy Note 8!,YouTube
4839,people are going to spend 800$ for some emojis,YouTube
4840,iPhone Xactly the same every time,YouTube
4841,"Wait, so there is no touch ID at all? I guess I thought face recognition was an option and there was still touch ID.  If no touch ID, I will never buy it.",YouTube
4842,I love my iPhone X,YouTube

4847,If you can use passcode instead of face id then im set,YouTube
4848,Such a top notch phone...oh,YouTube
4849,"iSheep. Same phone, higher price.",YouTube
4850,And pls...mention about the fast charging feature for extra 100 bucks,YouTube
4851,"I actually like the notch, it makes the phone cooler, why do people hate it!",YouTube
4852,"Can you stop saying ""there is STILL no headphone jack"". You make it sound like Apple never had it in the first place. They did, and they REMOVED it! So did Google. So will every other manufacturer. Get over it! The headphone jack is DEAD!   This is their third phone without it! It's pretty clear it's not coming back! Move on! You guys are like obsessed with an ex or something, can't look past it. Keep talking about it all the time.",YouTube
4853,Best mobile phone currently on the market.,YouTube

4866,I cancelled my Star Wars Battlefront 2 preorder in order to get this phone. So worth it.,YouTube

4874,"“Two stereo speakers flanking the lighting connector”  Incorrect.  One of the speakers is the earpiece, the other is the right, rear/side firing speaker.",YouTube

4876,But Im dead inside :/,YouTube

4881,"Filip seems to be pretty good at modeling, apparently.",YouTube
4882,That last Animoji part was terrible. Lips and audio not synced.,YouTube
4883,Samsung would get slammed by all these YouTubers if the Animoji crap was the highlight of one of the new galaxy phones. Seems every reviewer is smitten by the silly thing.,YouTube
4884,"24,022 unread emails?  There’s no contacting you is there?",YouTube
4885,“Steve Jobs would be disappointed” - says everyone who thinks they are Steve jobs.,YouTube
4886,... I love just how all these YouTubers mention out the fact that Samsung built the display for the iPhone x... ????,YouTube
4887,I’ve had the phone for half a day and the swipe gestures are already quite natural. Love this phone so far!,YouTube
4888,People complaining about the notch is the most millennial thing in the world....get over it. You spent $1000 on a phone. That should be more concerning to you.,YouTube
4889,"WHY do they always say  ""this is the best iPhone Apple has ever made"" EVERY launch. as if it was supposed to be worse than the previous model?",YouTube
4890,Don't buy this phone if you have a evil twin xD,YouTube
4891,Pls have a comparison with other flagship. We are very tired of this kind of review. Actually it is not review it is selling the products.,YouTube
4892,"So I use both IOS and Android. That being said It's really amazing that people are blowing their loads over this phone. ""the future""? The ""New norm""? How stupid are most people? Seriously though, this is years behind Android phones and just catching up now? And it's the same chipset as the 8 and with a basic bitch camera? I understand the term sheeple now more than ever.",YouTube
4893,WOW $1000 for an Emoji Phone!!!! Wow so revolutionary! Let me tell you this is it REALLY worth $1000? The same price as a decent and more powerful desktop computer or laptop?  Big whoop it’s the same as the 8 just a different screen I’ll buy a new phone when there’s an actual change,YouTube
4894,Nice review. Waiting a year for next years version is a smart move though.,YouTube
4895,Nice phone however I need to have Touch ID so hopefully the iPhone Xs or iPhone 11 will have it embedded into the screen!,YouTube
4896,is no one going to address the blue nail polish ?!,YouTube
4897,nail polish live's matter,YouTube
4898,"man, that nail is so distracting",YouTube
4899,"I feel bad for all the android users bashing it....I have literally never met anyone that was satisfied with an Android and they all eventually come over to Apple. Apple might be behind on features, but they tend to get it right",YouTube
4900,OK that ending was great lol,YouTube
4901,Watching the iPhone X review on my iPhone X... It’s a good day?,YouTube
4902,550$ to replace the glass back according to Apple.,YouTube
4903,Can you imagine how many car accidents there are going to be when drivers try figuring out this phone while driving? Holy crap.. Lol,YouTube
4904,"Why doesnt smb say you dont need a notch you dont need the front camera, you can have fingerprint reader in the back so you can have all screen phone. And there is already a phone with 2 displays and 1 camera that can be used as selfie cam because of the 2 displays or a phone where you can move the camera to face the back or front... And if you dont want two displays you can have a small mirror like thing(that goes well with design) for selfies...   Front facing cameras are pretty cool but are an overkill(for emojis). All screen design could've been much better. I will still call this phone iphone X it just seems eXperimental and not polished by design, that notch is hideous... And now twins can unlock your phones, so dont buy it if you have a evil twin xD",YouTube
4905,That last animoji bit was...hard to watch...you can't professionally tout a gimmick as a feature...For a phone over $1000...,YouTube
4906,This thing is overpriced garbage.,YouTube
4907,"Saw it in person today and was totally not impressed. I liked the smaller footprint but the phone feels too small, it’s basically the size of the iPhone 8.  No way it’s worth that much money",YouTube
4908,Still a crap...,YouTube
4909,"Ok wait so Apple heads made fun of the Note 7 cuz you had to put the phone near your face & swipe up saying(That took to long)now 1year later Apple's iPhone X does the exact same thing(put phone buy face & swipe up)but now it's ok cuz Apple made it? How does that work? I'm so done with Apple heads & all fellow Android folks should leave them alone also! For $1000 12million of them bought a phone that copies BB10(screen chesters)WindowPhone(Face Unlock)& Android(EVERYTHING ELSE)& they still walking around like they have something cool!???? I give up! Like they say 'U can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink'!!",YouTube
4910,1000$ for this? They deserve to get shot,YouTube
4911,The tech reviewer took a day to get used to the home control center gestures took me 30 seconds and I was wizzing through it time for you to retire,YouTube
4912,Had hands on today not worth the price tag my IPhone 7 Plus is still good for another 8 months for the iPhone 9 hopefully it will be worth the wait.,YouTube
4913,When pixel launched with squeeze ability people called it gimmick now animoji ?? Calling it as a feature woww ?? it's just a gimmick as well,YouTube
4914,Did you really just give credit to Apple for Samsung's display?...yeah sounds about right.?,YouTube
4915,"This phone honestly looks like an updated version of the Samsung Galaxy 4 (yes, four). I guess design has gone just about as far as it can go.",YouTube
4916,All these people hating....does anyone have the phone yet? Or has anyone seen it in person? I think it's too early to make a call right now.,YouTube
4917,I love iPhones but as someone who pays attention to all things tech I think you sound like you’ve been paid to say nice things. The new emoji feature has to be most gimmicky feature I’ve ever seen and that notch is hideous. For a $1000 the camera should be leaps and bounds better and so should the battery. This phone may look nice and it may be the best iPhone but there’s a lot to not like.,YouTube
4918,Got to love all these salty android fanboys in the comment section. Enjoy.,YouTube
4919,Gotta give it to Apple...they managed to blatantly rip off consumers for this overpriced gimmick device.,YouTube
4920,The nail was almost as distracting as that notch.,YouTube
4921,Only jackasses buy Apple products.,YouTube
4922,The distracting placement of the camera is hideous. Steve Jobs wouldn't have approved. Big step backwards.,YouTube
4923,Paid review,YouTube
4924,Never buy a phone based on the hype. Be it iphone or samsung. Just buy a phone that does what you need it to do and you like how it looks.,YouTube
4925,"That notch would be a lot smaller if only Apple could get the touchID sensor in the back. Since they didn't, users are stuck with this slower, creepy FaceID alternative that nobody asked for.",YouTube
4926,"Sorry but Steve Jobs would be literally Murdering Tim Cook in his office if he was alive as this phone is basically a Galaxy S8 with a huge cut out notch on the face of the phone ,sorry but come on im not stupid all Apple did was copy Samsung,s near bezel-less design and add facial recognition , this is why i stopped using I phones after the 7 as the company has just gradually morphed into a posher version of Samsung , true innovation in the style of Steve Jobs would have been a totally different design unlike anything we have ever seen before , my idea of what he would have thought up would be  a see through phone made entirely of transparent Aluminum  ,and yes Transparent Aluminum does now exist its no longer the stuff of Star Trek , also the screen would be an 8k, 120hz display and yes this does too exist as the new Razer phone is using this technology anyway my point is simple Apple are just interested in making quick profit they are no longer innovators or dreamers like Jobs and Wozniak were.",YouTube
4927,1st,YouTube
4928,Apple will remove the charging port on the next iphone to go completely wireless. Apple fast wireless charger will be $200 ?,YouTube
4929,This phone is a joke,YouTube
4930,Hmmm Samsung made a screen for Apple ? totally not suspicious,YouTube
4931,To me Samsung makes better looking phones,YouTube
4932,Honestly this phone is worth 500 dollars.. NOTE 8 PHONE OF THE YEAR. PIXEL  2XL. FIX YOUR BLUE SCREEN..PLEASE GOOD TRY,YouTube
4933,Too late yellow fellow...,YouTube
4934,So you're paying over a $1000 for face ID and animoji? What is the point of this phone if it runs the same as Iphone8? Especially since Iphones are all about performance. How is this pointless device getting such positive reviews?,YouTube
4935,This phone is clearly one of the best Android phones out today...,YouTube
4936,Can someone link the wallpaper used in the video?,YouTube
4937,anyone know what that shooting game is called that he was playing towards the end of the video?,YouTube
4938,Note 8 is way better,YouTube
4939,Samsung probably overcharged them for the oled panel to recoup lost money from apples many lawsuits.,YouTube
4940,"Don’t kid yourself this phone is NOT worth $1,000. 700 at most",YouTube
4941,This review was literally nothing,YouTube
4942,Someone call for an ambulance!! Apple just killed the competition,YouTube
4943,Who’s watching on their iPhone X,YouTube
4944,I’ll just stick to my iphone 7 plus,YouTube

4946,S8 is much better wayway sexy than this,YouTube
4947,That notch ruins the entire design imo.,YouTube
4948,HAH!SUCKS!,YouTube
4949,What is the next thing apple are removing from the iPhone? The screen?,YouTube
4950,This  iPhone x is great,YouTube
4951,??? ????? ???????,YouTube
4952,Something about this reviewer was well thought out and had a good touch to it. Good job man!,YouTube
4953,"Good job iphone  But y would u buy a phone that cost round £700 where u could buy another phone with similar features for a good price. The phone  that anyone needs is that it has 3/4GB of RAM, 12 mega pixel camera and a 2300 or more mAh battery capicty  Phones u could get ; Huawei p10 lite, sony xperia xa1 for £200 Save ur money",YouTube
4954,If Only Apple listens to its customers about having a Micro Sd storage and stop taking ppls money Thru mandatory icloud storage. Smh ????,YouTube
4955,Notch is not a big issue like ppl seem to enjoy making it,YouTube
4956,"I have the Note 8 and this phone. I love this phone, the notch and the gestures. Not sure why. Just love it. Even love Face ID.",YouTube
4957,Where can I get the Wallpaper ? I really dig it !,YouTube
4958,Face ID sometimes fails to me too when I just wake up. In any other scenario it works flawlessly.,YouTube
4959,"Listen guys, the iPhone X is a TOP NOTCH device.....   No pun intended xD",YouTube
4960,"After watching some The Verge and MKBHD videos, this, to my eyes, look poorly produced.",YouTube

4970,Why does it feel like this guy is trying to be like Michael Fisher? His speaking pattern is very similar if you ask me....,YouTube

4972,Watching this on my s8,YouTube
4973,you don't get fast charging out of the box! you have to buy!,YouTube
4974,There are very oddly similar reviews I've seen... so much so that even some of the shots were the same (where the phone is leaning against the drinking glass). I've had the X for 3 days now and I feel like I've paid $1200 for animojis and a smaller screen. The screen maybe taller but definitely narrower with a smaller feel. I love apple but I'm returning it for sure.,YouTube
4975,It's a nice upgrade coming from a 6s plus that I know for sure.,YouTube
4976,"A rock from 40000 years ago: Affordable, durable, worth a lot since ancient     iPhone X: Not affordable, not durable, not ancient",YouTube
4977,this video is bad,YouTube
4978,They took away the headphone jack next up the charging port. Wireless charging is gonna be the only way to charge your iPhone in the future,YouTube
4979,I'm not going to buy it unless they put an earphone jack.,YouTube
4980,"face recognition is CREEPY!!!  Other than that, it looks like a nice phone but I have serious issues about spending $1000 .... for a phone.  My 4s is still going strong and look how much money I have saved!",YouTube
4981,"I'm sure I'd get used to it, but these reviews have made me glad I got the iPhone 8. I just don't believe this is worth $300 more. In two and a half years when my contract is up I'm sure apple will have made a much better phone!",YouTube
4982,Now the YouTubers should keep their head such that it doesn't get cropped while watching video in full screen ????,YouTube
4983,I looooove this phone,YouTube

4998,I an not Apple or Google fanboy      I am Supersaf fanboy!,YouTube
4999,As an iPhone x owner I do agree with your review. The iphone is a top-notch phone :),YouTube
5000,In India IPhone X costs about  $1340 (64 GB Variant ) !!! Not worth it,YouTube
5001,"SuperSaf Video 1: S8 vs iphone x, S8 wins  Video 2:note 8 vs iphone x,note 8 wins  Video 3: received a giant gift  from samsung yeaaahhhhhhh!!!!",YouTube
5002,"I totally agree with your review saf, I'm gonna be doing a small review on the X and the dynamic range on the front facing camera sucks big time. Plus speaking on what Apple promised, the A11 bionic chip has its flaws like the phone lags at a few apps n stuff.. And the battery optimization could be better to what we're paying. They could've even added some RAM for that price. :) just saying. So the money we're paying is not worth for the IPhone X.",YouTube
5003,"Well said, SuperSaf! I returned my iPhone X. Disappointed!",YouTube
5004,hehehe dat thumbnail tho..... Top-Notch,YouTube
5005,_Amazing Thumbnail ??_,YouTube
5006,What About the LG V30!!,YouTube
5007,Got new Galaxy Note 8 today!!,YouTube
5008,"As an iPhone X owner, I agree with most of what he is saying. I agree with the front facing camera needing improvements, especially with portrait mode. I also agree with the lack of a well organized notification system. I believe the way Face ID and gestures have been integrated into this device is almost flawless.",YouTube
5009,"I had the iPhone X, i liked it but didn't love it, been an IOS and Mac user since the iPhone 4, i returned my iPhone x as IOS 11 is super buggy and i didn't feel the phone is worth £999, i have went with a OnePlus 5T and i am happy, other than the on the 5T camera isn't fantastic, but you can't beat the price ??",YouTube
5010,5th comment. Love you Saf?,YouTube
5011,Good thumbnail man,YouTube
5012,Watching on an iPhone X! ????,YouTube
5013,With the price in india i can buy a note8(which i have) and one plus 5t(which i'll buy currently using 3t).. but still instead of buying this shit i can have 2 phones with the best of the best in any smartphone.,YouTube
5014,"You bash Apple for being overpriced and yet you go out and buy a Note 8 for 900 only to have it drop in price significantly a few months later close to half its original price. How would you feel if you buy $1000 pair of shoes and 3 months later, it’s 500? I would feel pissed and ripped off. I wouldn’t buy that particular pair of shoes ever again. It’s all comes down to what you like and what you can afford. The iPhone X may not be the one for you but for others it is the best smart phone. Every company is out to get your money. There are some features that lack in the note that one might want to go for the iPhone instead to get them. The note doesn’t do everything right. This is coming from a person who has used a note before. For example, in terms of ergonomics; ease of use with one hand, pocketable, iPhone X suits me better",YouTube
5015,"I have the X,  but I really like the S8 so I’m gonna buy that (£400 second hand). With both phones there are pros and cons, the Apple eco system is just soo much better than androids, iOS is leaps and bounds ahead of android imo, but some people love it and that’s okay. Some people love the android customisation and really want that feature on the phone which puts them off iPhones, and that’s okay too. I love that the S8 has ip68 proofing and wish iPhones had it, cause I’ll be using the S8 underwater for footage when I go swimming or diving. Both great phones so people really gotta stop hating when it’s all down to just what someone likes",YouTube
5016,"In all honesty if I had a option of a iPhone X or OnePlus 5T for my phone (and I couldn't sell it or swap it), OnePlus wins for sure, there isn't actually an area where the OnePlus is much worse than the iPhone X (maybe camera), but multitasking, charging,  software features, fingerprint scanner and faster facial recognition, the OnePlus offers more for half the price",YouTube
5017,hey saf! please do the oneplus 5t camera review or camera comparison with flagship models thanks,YouTube
5018,Love me I phone 10 ?,YouTube
5019,First,YouTube

5021,Why is everybody Indian in the comments?,YouTube
5022,"Why the hell are people moaning about the notch? Don’t they see the alternate is to have a bezel all the way across the top? Instead Apple chose to give us the top left and right corners of the screen, and the more screen, the better.",YouTube
5023,This phone is good but it cant replace samsung S8,YouTube
5024,Not worth the money,YouTube
5025,"Yep, too expensive for what it offers. Have been an iOS user for over 7 years now but had to ditch it because I just can't afford it. There's just a lot of options out there way cheaper and will get the job done as well.",YouTube
5026,IPhone x is overpriced...,YouTube
5027,Hi,YouTube
5028,??,YouTube
5029,Yeah! It's a great phone but not worth the price.,YouTube

5031,"When I picked up an iPhone X I knew it was the phone for me. When I dropped & smashed the iPhone X, I knew it was not for me.",YouTube

5033,Why are people just allowing themselves to be ripped off by Apple. Vote with your wallet.,YouTube
5034,good job samsung could you please buy apple and do the body of an s8 plus apple ios mash up that would be the best phone ever plus changing the fingerprint location plus adding face id that phone will sell like hotcakes,YouTube

5039,Finally a good thumbnail and not you I’m some dorky ass sun glasses,YouTube
5040,"Yea, no phone is worth $1000 until it has some ""new features"" ( and not an upgrade of features over its previous models). I personally think that people should get ""Flagship - killer"" category smartphones and buy high quality accessories for it.",YouTube
5041,"The whole thing with sunglasses, glasses, as well as laying in bed and not being able to use Face ID is the reason I’m actually considering going back and getting the 8+. Also, you mention the bezels when watching video, and how they would “be there anyways.” Untrue. The different is that the iPhone X screen is 5.8 in, vs the 5.5 in on the 8+. Pretty sure almost an inch of screen bezel is present when watching a video on the X. The 8+ uses the whole screen. If there are screen bezels, they’re on the top and bottom and you still get the full width of the screen so, really, the 8+ gets more screen use.",YouTube
5042,You are awesome dude????????,YouTube
5043,"I appreciate the video.   I still can't justify $1K+ cost based upon ""you'll get use to this"" & ""get over that"" eventually. Apple have a chance to make it amazing before launch, not turn iPhone X users into beta testers.",YouTube
5044,"Definitely agree that laying down with my face half obscured by a pillow and Face ID not working is very undesirable. The phone is great, but it’s not perfect. Bring back Touch ID, add stereo mic, extend battery life to 24 hours, dual app multitasking and now we’re talking.",YouTube

And so have other manufacturers been using Samsung parts for years. Heck the Pixel 2 screen is a Samsung screen, and the Pixel 2 XL is an LG screen! Nobody says: ""good job samsung"" for that huh.  In fact, my Galaxy S8 is using a storage chip sourced from Sony! Good job Sony on the S8!  Oh and most phones use memory from samsung, so we can also say good job samsung!

5090,"After weeks of using my iPhone X, I recommend the X by a wide margin. The FaceID works every time, and is nearly instantaneous. Being able to use FaceID with Apple Pay is another major advantage. I can do everything with the iPhone X in one hand, from selecting apps, scrolling between apps, and using all areas of the screen with my thumb. The screen is absolutely superb, bright and clear, even in very bright ambient light. I am a heavy advocate of Siri, and the accuracy, speed and ease on the X is far better than my previous iPhone 7 Plus. I can get two days of use with one charge, and I enjoy the Animoji and Portrait Lighting features on the X. As for price, I have a 256GB version, with a superb Apple leather folio case. All up, just under $1,300. I use the upgrade program, making the cost $55 per month. Excellent value. My best friend switched to Samsung, to cut costs, and changed back to iPhone after two weeks. The Samsung looks and functions like a generic Pc, versus an Apple MacBook Pro. Given the massive amount I use my iPhone, and the general amazing usability across iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, the costs are a tiny investment compared to the benefits. There’s way too little discussion of the financial and operational benefits of going all-in with Apple. My experience has taken my communications and workload much better, compared to the feedback I get from PC, Surface and assorted Smartphone users. Anyone who can’t see the value-added from platform quality, usability, residual values, software and support has hang-ups with Apple that probably require the services of a skilled psychotherapist!",YouTube

5147,Guys pick iPhone 8 not iPhone X,YouTube
5148,I got iPhone 8 plus 256 GB recently and I must say I m quite satisfied.I previously owned iPhone 6s plus for 2yrs and wanted to buy iPhone X but changed my mind at the last moment.I want to wait for a year or two to see where apple goes from here.Pros for 8plus: 1)Speakers and overall sound quality is SUPER amazing. 2)True tone along with retina HD screen is quite good as it helps to make the screen and apps look more vibrant. 3)With the glass back the phone is more sturdy to hold in hand and looks vintage. 4)It supports wireless fast charging just like iPhone X. 5)Battery is also better than 6S plus.(half an hour extra life) moderate usage 6)I felt that the bezel of 8 plus is couple of mm's shorter than on 6s plus when I placed the phones side by side.I may be wrong.It is not visible readily. Cons 1)Camera is good but not up to the level of many other phones in the market.I felt iPhone X is better than 8plus in this aspect. 2)True tone doesn't do justice at low level light. 3)It's quite heavy to carry(202 gms),YouTube
5149,I’m waiting til next year to get the X,YouTube
5150,"I am still on my iPhone 6S and I saw no reason to upgrade to 7 and I see no reason to upgrade to 8 or X.

5170,"IPhone 8 is best of the 3, it’s the cheapest and has the best value. You’re sacrificing screen size for pocket ability which is a fair trade, the iPhone 8 is also as powerful as both the 8+ and 10. The only big difference between the 3 is the screen and camera. The 8+ is a nice middle ground as it has cameras not as bad as the 8 or as good as the 10. In my opinion the 8+’s screen is best of the 3 as it is a good size and has a nice aspect ratio. (Even though it’s not a bright OLED) The only people who really would get a 10 are people who don’t understand the technical specifications of the 3 and only care about their status on social media and all that shit, they just see it as $400 for some shitty animojis.",YouTube

5243,So basically they stole Blackberry 10s swipe gestures that was developed years ago. Sure... Great. I'm paying a $1000 to fund a company that cannot create anything original. Wonderful. Screen is an exact copy of s8. The notch where the camera sits in the middle is absolutely horrible. It bothers me so much... Very annoying. I mean for a $1000 you expect to get a perfect device but it seems to be imperfect with a lot of flaws.,YouTube

For 1 Samsung has much more customisation, for fuck sakes you can't even get rid of built in apps from the home screen, all you can do is shove them in a folder and tuck it in a corner and forget about it, I could go one and on about customization. 2nd you get much more space then an iPhone, much more ram, more screen, better battery life, slightly better camera, better water resistance, etc. Look I could go on and on about how (in my opinion) Samsung is more just ""alive"" than apple. It is just preference, I know that,  although some people just have an iPhone just as a status symbol (not all).

And because the iPhone 8 Plus also has the A11 Bionic chip for AR capabilities, same Potrait Lighting, water resistance and a glass back allowing for wireless charging, I now think that price to performance ratio, the iPhone 8 Plus wins it. It also still retains the home button and fingerprint scanner while still being cheaper than both the iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and other high end flagships. For some reason, after consider, to buy the iPhone 8 Plus instead of the iPhone X seems more feasible because in practical day to day use, it's still as fast as the iPhone X.

5424,"Great review! One more thing though: the new changes made to the iPhone X signal an entirely new way of doing things for iPhone users that makes the X far more long-lasting than either the 8 or 8 Plus, so it's also worth the $1000+ if you don't want to seem in the dust with your phone 3 or 4 years from now.  Eventually, many apps will showcase features that work seamlessly on the X because of how its new layout is designed, but which might feel clunky on a ""classic"" iPhone, even the 8 or 8 Plus. It won't be a matter of ""how fast can this phone handle this app"" but rather ""how well is this app designed with this phone in mind, and how intuitive does it feel"", a subtle difference that the iPhone X is worse in right now, but will far outpace the 8 and 8 Plus at over time, along with every other iPhone that doesn't have Face ID, gestures, and even something like the notch.  That's a big reason why I'm getting the iPhone X instead of the 8 or 8 Plus. It was something I couldn't really fully grasp until I played around with a demo unit on launch day. Even watching reviewers play around a bit more with it before launch day, they gave so much more info that ended up helping so much.  They helped show how even what seemed to be a downside actually had some really cool figure potential, like the notch.   Or what seemed kind of clunky at first glance was actually so well crafted, genius when all put together, like the gestures.  Or that what seemed like it was just a gimmick that was going to flop (Animoji) was actually showing seriously untapped potential (from the facial recognition), leverage for new, useful experiences that I can't even imagine right now.  These aren't things that I could fully appreciate after watching the Apple Event: it was only once I saw others use it, and start to use it myself, that I finally understood. And that changed everything.  For me, someone who's switching back to iOS all the way back from the 4S, after getting frustrated with the hardcore lag coming from every Android I've ever owned, including my current S7, not even satisfied enough with the Pixel 2 or the OnePlus 5 for their performance, and kinda missing not connecting with friends and family as much when they pretty much all have iMessage and FaceTime, the new generation of iPhones was the clear winner, and given their unparalleled benchmarks, they're also kinda futureproofed (with a case!).  All said and done, the iPhone X was a no-brainer for me. An expensive no-brainer, one that I'm finding ways to pay for, but so much so that it became worth the $1000. Actually, it was worth the $1200, because I ordered the 256GB version to make it even more futureproof.  So long as my phone don't lag all the f**king time, I plan on keeping my phones for a long time. And with iPhones known for lasting very long, with very little noticeable lag even from the iPhone 6S and 7, and with future apps leveraging how the iPhone X and future iPhones will do things, if you've got the money (or if you're ready to work it into your budget after ordering it, like me lol), and if you want something that will last (both in hardware and in intuitiveness), then the iPhone X is also for you.   So not jusssst for rich people, but also for future-minded iPhone users.",YouTube

5438,I managed to get the s8 for 550 euros back in june. Seeing as the iphone in Europe will cost upwards if 1200 euros. I think the s8 is prolly the best option for a phone right now high end with great features plus similarly priced with one plus 5 atleast here where I live. I don't think there is a bettrr bang for your buck high end phone. The note 8 or pixel xl are not worth the 300 euros more for debatable meaningless features. Just my 2 cents.,YouTube

As of right now I am flabbergasted that the first sentence out of your mouth was about the price and then you declared that the entire review was going to be about whether the phone was worth the price. Like I said link me to a single other review where you judge a phone solely on that merit and I will re-sub to your channel and apologize but this is partisan hack bullshit. Did you even asked the fucking question of whether the note 8 is worth $1000? Or are we pretending that there is a huge difference here since the note 8 starts at like $40 less?Didn’t even watch this review past the 20 second mark so I don’t really care what your conclusion was because the fact of the matter is none of these flagship phones are worth $800-$1000 but to sum up your review of this one phone on that way is a hacky partisan attack, not an actual review. Fuck this.",YouTube
5458,Finally a honest review :-) As always Mr Mobile,YouTube
5459,#perfect review.....best review....,YouTube

5461,Apples to Durian ;),YouTube
5462,"Apples to.. durians.  Lol nice one, since durian is king of fruits to some peoples.",YouTube
5463,"I like this review a lot. It's less than ten minutes, yet it gets the point out. This phone is a great device, but it's for a specific market. There are plenty of other phones that can do better than what the X can do, but because it's Apple and it's their tenth anniversary of the iPhone, they can do what they want to the price and people will still buy it.",YouTube
5464,$1000 phone with face ID thats going to give you cataracts in your eyes!!! sounds like a good price!!!,YouTube
5465,here in Israel it cost 1800$ u needs to work 2 months to get an iPhone,YouTube
5466,Sometimes your complains about a phone are so stupid,YouTube
5467,Stupide phone and only for the rich at $1150 which will be obsolete next year.,YouTube
5468,Samsung display saved this phone and apple from totall failure.That is a fact..,YouTube
5469,Not grand??? It’s the best smartphone ever by FAR!!! And I owned all android/iOS flagships,YouTube
5470,I just loved the last comment that Iphone 10 is just for rich people and tech enthusiasts ???so true!,YouTube
5471,"""The phone for the flashy folks""",YouTube
5472,"iPhones always been good phones?, but Samsung phones are soooooo feature rich.?",YouTube
5473,"Your sir, just with this honest review got yourself a new subscriber. Thank you for putting the truth out there. I have been an Android user ever since the HTC Desire HD my first smartphone and have never owned an iPhone for all of the reasons you've kindly mentioned plus no option for an micro SD and most importantly everything has to be done through iTunes while with Android it's just drag and drop. Love the ""cynical cash grab"" soooooo true! Fast charging adapters are standard out of the box for any Android phone. Such an expensive phone with less or outdated features and over $500 to replace a screen. Funny thing is, that metal around the screen still look like bezels.  I own a Samsung Galaxy S8+ since its launch and just got the new HTC U11+ also launch day couple of days ago here in Taiwan and they both have more features than the iPhone X. In fact the U11+ with 128GB / 6GB ram, 6 Inch Quad HD display, Quad DAC with Qualcomm aptX HD which through BT 5.0 provides LDAC (3x normal BT speed) 24bit Hi-Res audio WIRELESSLY! IP68 Water resistant, Dual speakers with boom sound Hi-Fi, almost 4000mah battery, Squeeze function which launches an Edge Launcher which is a wheel where you can add all your apps and quick settings and turn it with your thumb which is perfect for one handed use. You can map the long squeeze to launch anything you want. Last but not least, it supports microSD card so I'm using a 256GB but ordered the new 400GB from SanDisk. I paid $700 for the phone and $250 for the microSD card so $950 for this incredible phone with a total storage of 528GB.",YouTube
5474,"What good is 4K 60fps or any video with MONO audio? My brand new $700  HTC U11+ can record 4K 30fps but with 3D or Hi-Res audio. It has Quad microphones, 3D audio allows the audio to zoom in with the video.",YouTube
5475,It's not worth 1k.,YouTube

5480,Hmmm. I wander how many video i have  watched about this. Wish i had the money?,YouTube
5481,"I understand your concerns but please don't compare with a Note 8 JUST because of the price. Maybe I don't want a note-sized phone, I don't need a stylus... compare with S8, yes, but Note 8 is not fair comparison as the market is different",YouTube

5486,I prefer the Samsung galaxy S8 S8+ or the Note 8,YouTube
5487,"For a non-techy user like me, this review is actually really nice but let's be real here, this phone isn't worth 1,000 USD.   I'm sticking with Apple only for two things: simple iOS and I own other Apple products. I'll keep my iPhone 6s and will only upgrade once the price of the iPhone X goes down, which won't likely happen anytime soon.",YouTube

5578,"I bought the 6SPlus a couple of years ago because I’m a video producer and wanted/needed the bigger screen. But I’m also a short woman with small hands, so the user experience with that phone was kinda miserable. For TWO YEARS! I was constantly struggling to do even the smallest tasks with one hand. When I found that the X came with a bigger screen in essentially the body of a regular iPhone, there was no need to tell me anything more. I was SOLD. That single change literally solved my biggest iPhone complaint. I solved my second biggest complaint by buying the larger storage version (250+GB), so it ended up costing something like $1300.   Worth Every Penny.  The thing that I’ve learned from 10 years of iPhone ownership is that it NEVER pays to go with the lesser version to save some money. The trade offs in user experience are too large. By going with a lesser storage on my last phone, I spent the next 2 YEARS constantly dumping photos ands apps so I could take more photos and install more apps. That was a weekly (sometimes daily) occurrence, and for what? The savings of a hundred bucks? Never again.   My advice: Buy the very MOST phone you can possibly afford. Be clear about what really matters to you in a phone, and then get the MOST of that feature that is available. Trust me; You’ll never regret OVER-equipping yourself, but you will definitely regret UNDER-equipping yourself. Like every time you have to play “Sophie’s Choice” with your favorite pictures.",YouTube

Even the S7 Edge has more specs, Just, google both Specifications and you'll find out the truth. If there's one good thing about iPhone's OS is their soft and Fancy Interface, but after all, both OS are EQUALLY good. :)",YouTube

Receptionist said had a galaxy 6 and didn't like how it was like a computer.  She said ""I like being able to to text and make phone calls this is why I got a iPhone besides all the useless apps)  I said you could atleast clear cache, disable, and force stop""  she replied ""I don't use my phone like a computer like most people""  wanted to say why buy these outrageously priced phones then and get a version of a 2004 flip phone then.  And expressing to me theirs to many steps.  Everytime I've helped a iPhone user there are almost triple than a andriod.  I don't really care get what you want and spend more than what I spend on my brand new hp laptop i3 2.4ghz 64 bit touch screen upgraded to 16gb ddr4 crucial ram and western digital 1tb 7200 black edition, wifi is ac, and blue tooth put windows 10 room with dual boot centos. My phone yeah andriod moto e4 under $60 with fingerprint unlock.  And a total of $620 for a laptop instead of what $800 for a phone?

5662,When Samsung placed a Bixby button on the sides of their flagship phones everyone was ranting on it. But haven't anyone noticed the power button on the IPhone X now used to open siri so isn't that somewhat a siri button and tbh after using both I feel bixby is more useful as you can teach it many things. So basically when apple puts a button like that no-one has a problem and no-one even talks abt it. Why do people always find out bad things abt Samsung phones but when apple makes mistake they all just ignore it,YouTube

5690,No iPhone is worth its hype. Great phone but definitely overrated and overpriced.,YouTube
5691,"Supreme production, love this channel.",YouTube
5692,the dummiest feature of iPhone X is the Animoji,YouTube
5693,The best display on ANY smartphone,YouTube
5694,Nope it’s not,YouTube
5695,I SEEM TO ALWAYS LOVE I PHONE BUT when i grew up... i just realized apple is a bit.... dull than android phones such as samsung note 8,YouTube
5696,steep learning curve? it's a cellphone not a hadron collider,YouTube
5697,How do you spell the wireless charger company?? Can’t find it. Thanks!!,YouTube
5698,"I am an Android user ever since, but as I saw every spec about the iPhone X, I consider this probably one of the most revolutionary phones ever made. Definitely my GadgetMatch, though not my price match ?",YouTube
5699,At last a good review,YouTube
5700,nextyear model maybe,YouTube
5701,The notch is one of the huge design blunders of 2017.,YouTube
5702,That fox is Michael Fisher! <3,YouTube
5703,"Dear Gadget Match team, where have you been? Please do some more videos!! I'am waiting for a review of the moto x4 and the HTC U11 series. Don't make so many videos about a overpriced smartphone. Btw. Michael Josh, when you are next time in Germany give some lessons to your German colleagues.!!!",YouTube
5704,I remember a time when a premium price came with innovation and no compromises....Iphone X is revolutionary,YouTube
5705,Is there anywhere I can see more pictures or videos of the IPhone X blending into the background like in the thumbnail. It looks really cool.,YouTube
5706,This review is the craziest among others! Love it??,YouTube

5720,Very good review thanks,YouTube
5721,"I think the swipe to unlock is good. Without it you can’t check the time, the phone would automatically go to home screen screen so you’ll have to lock your phone just for checking the time.",YouTube

5725,What about the virtual reality thing that was in the iPhone X commercial,YouTube
5726,"Price is never an issue for Apple fans, so please don't go bashing them in the comment section. It's their money, they are free to do what they want with it.  #YouROCKGadgetMatch #iphoneuserhere",YouTube
5727,"It costs a thousand dollars now.. but how about next year 2018 up to year 2019, is your $1000 iphoneX still worth the price considering that the cheaper smartphones are getting better at a fraction of that pricepoint? Anyways this is just my personal opinion, I have nothing against apple iphoneX since I'm an iphone owner as well. More power to your channel. This is still a great review by the way ?",YouTube
5728,"I wish they did the same quality and testing with the other phone, not only iphone...",YouTube
5729,"If you have to cover a glass back and pay insane prices for replacement just put a metal back instead. It is just marketing for the phone accessory market to cash in.  Edit: Actually, it is after market blackmail Apple is doing. You will have to buy a cover to protect your phone or face a 'fine' for breaking it. You will have to buy a fast charger otherwise enjoy super slow charge speeds. You will have to buy Airpods because they are forcing you to use bluetooth headphones otherwise enjoy music with a pair of cheap wired earbuds with a adapter that comes with your 1K phone.",YouTube
5730,Here in my country 256gb variant of iphone X cost 1750$ thats too much for phone??.,YouTube
5731,"Feels great to hold, and the screen is excellent. But that price tag, its getting ridiculous and will be getting higher every year",YouTube
5732,Man i love the quality of this video!,YouTube
5733,watching this on my Samsung 8+... ?,YouTube
5734,Hey GadgetMatch Can you do a Unboxing and Review of The New ASUS Zenfone Max Plus M1.,YouTube

5736,Lol Is it weird that my friend has an iPhone x and she is just 10 yo?? ??????,YouTube
5737,I love it but hate price.,YouTube
5738,Wonderful review josh! Proud to be a fellow singaporean,YouTube
5739,"I was on the iStore at Ayala Cebu few days ago to see and test the iPhone X (ten). Since the phone's body is made from ""the strongest glass ever made for a smartphone"", it must be bullet-proof. I hope that will be our life-saver. ""Ooh!""",YouTube
5740,Definitely Not worth it when there are phones like the OnePlus available for less than half the price.,YouTube
5741,Singaporean Asian version of Linus tech tips lolll,YouTube
5742,But nobody uses iMessage/sms in this part of the world anymore..haizz,YouTube
5743,Hmmm sorry not worth the hype. I'm more into the use and the technology. The price did not justify its functionality.,YouTube
5744,too biased. Unsubscribed,YouTube

5757,Super fun iPhone yet!,YouTube
5758,Singapore?,YouTube
5759,You’re telling people nothing different than any other reviewers. People are more interested in the dislikes. This was a waste of time. Yes I’m an iPhone user with the 8 plus. I took my x back because it costed more for stuff that’s the same as the 8 plus,YouTube
5760,Can't wait for my iPhone X to come in the mail,YouTube
5761,"If I am surprised about anything with the iPhone X, it is the battery life. It is a lot better than I expected it to be. I used to push my Galaxy S6 edge to death throughout the day, every day, and I would be at 50% battery halfway through my work day. With my iPhone X, and even heavier usage, I still have about 30%-40% battery life left over by the time I get home. My only disappointment relating to the battery would be the exclusion of a Fast Charger in the box. C’mon Apple, that’s just wack as fuck. ?",YouTube
5762,But what if your skin gets loose? Do you guys get my point? What if my skin gets old. Will it still recognize me? Or do I have to update my record Face ID every month?,YouTube
5763,"""A steep learning curve"" why does everyone keep saying that? You swipe up or swipe down to access what you're used to. It takes 30 seconds to adjust lol.",YouTube
5764,I returned my iPhone X got an iPhone 8 Plus. Better battery no wonky Face ID or ugly notch and more surface area on a display that doesn’t turn bluish off axis. Touch ID is faster. So happy to have the home button back!,YouTube
5765,FC BAYERN MUNCHEN.... ;),YouTube
5766,"Why does everyone complain about having to swipe up after phone unlocks? Sometimes, you just want to see your notifications without going to the home screen. That was the problem with touch ID for me, I would get a notification, pick up the phone to see what it was and because of the touch feature which I would have to remind myself not to activate any time I wanted to just view notifications, I would end up at my home screen when all I wanted to do was read a headline or something. That swipe up feature avoids all that. This also is handy if you get a notification from someone that you dont want to respond to right away but wish to read their message. With touch, sometimes when you get that notification and the phone opens up, it goes straight to the message and depending on what app that message is from, the person who sent it can see that you have read it sometimes several minutes or even hours before you reply. I dont like that.",YouTube
5767,"Why is learning to a few gestures a steep learning curve? Learning to swipe up on a screen takes a second to learn. Getting use to doing it, maybe a day or two.",YouTube
5768,I have both the pixel 2 xl and iphone X. The pixel is my main phone and the iphone is my back up phone. The iphone X looks amazing display and design wise. But software and IOS is trash. IOS is so barebones/restricting/and boring. All iphones look exactly the same and IOS is outdated at this point. Seriously IOS has the same icons since the first iPhone. Like Are you fucking serious. But the Iphone looks pretty so I bought it as my back up phone lol. No doubt is has an amazing display and I love watching stuff on it. But when it comes down to software and IOS . Its outdated and just plain boring . Plus it has nowhere near the settings and features I get on android. If Iphones had the same tyoe of free software android had . Apple would be KING of smartphones. But no they decided to keep the same outdated boring piece of shit software. So i only use the iphone when my pixel dies tbh. Most of the time the iphone X just sits in my bag . And i keep it on stand by just incase my pixel dies or I pull it out if I want to show off I have two premium phones lol. To be completely honest I just bought the Iphone X to flex . I rarely even use it.,YouTube
5769,Another great review. ?,YouTube
5770,Steep learning curve?????????,YouTube
5771,Watching this in my X and its kinda cool...,YouTube
5772,fun video! it's like we experienced iphone x too.,YouTube
5773,Am I the only one that likes the notch,YouTube
5774,I agree no fast charger in the box is a load of bs. Shame on Apple for not including it,YouTube
5775,I think swiping up is necessary. I don’t want to go straight to the home screen every time I look at my phone. Sometimes I just want to see who text or called me or what notifications just came thru. Going straight to the home screen every time I look at my phone would get annoying very quickly,YouTube
5776,oneplus 5t,YouTube
5777,Really bad display screen iphone x in all features and design because of the Notch,YouTube
5778,"very good review sir, eagerly waiting for oneplus 5t review  :D",YouTube

5785,8:19 ouch my ears.,YouTube
5786,"Actually, you can turn off the facial aware thing in the settings, so it's less needed to look straight at the phone. I have it on for an extra layer of protection. For me at this moment so far, Face ID has been working great! Better then touch id, which give me the wiggle thing a lot and still asked my pascode. I have no problem whatsoever with Face ID and i just really like everything about my iPhone X :-)",YouTube
5787,"In order to call others stupid, android users have to prove being smarter. Seeing all the comments, they are not doing well so far.",YouTube

First, don’t wait for the lock to unlock then swipe, just swipe up and by the time you have finished that motion it will be unlocked and be going to the Home screen, plenty fast.  Second, I had a fail when I had my face in a pillow, how did I solve this?  I turned my had a bit.  It really has been better than I thought and I’ve used Apple Pay with it about 8 times the last few days and that was a better experience than Touch ID for me and super fast.",YouTube

5844,"Samsung S8 is better than iPhone X in following ways: + Costs half as much, 550€ vs 1100€ + Bigger screen, but smaller phone. No notch, which renders the top sides of iP X pretty useless screen space. + Much lighter, even though the screen is the same. iPhone X is really heavy. + 3,5mm Headphone jack + fingerprint scanner + S8 is IP68 water resistant, iPhone X is just IP67 + S8 has bigger battery and better battery life (GSMarena testing) + Higher resolution display + Better selfie camera + Can do VR + SD card slot, memory expandable to 320GB + Standard USB C 3.1 port, iPhone X has proprietary slow USB 2.0 port. + Always on display + full NFC capability + aptX for bluetooth audio",YouTube

5854,"Thanks for a great video. I just returned my Iphone X. I normally love everything I have from Apple, but this one is not for me. Its slower to open and many things is to slow to do. When I pay this kind of money from a phone, It has to Rock`n Roll from first minut. Only very rich people can wait for things to be fixed later, and not return the phone. But of cause only IMO :-)",YouTube
5855,"Apple didn’t only reinvent their iPhone brand, they also “reinvented” my love for the iPhone. I never loved a smartphone this much. I love my iPhone X even more than I loved my first ever iPhone",YouTube

5879,No headphone jack ? How you supposed to use the earpods then,YouTube
5880,"Let’s be clear, just like with Touch ID, you had to press the home button while using your fingerprint to get in. It’s the same with Face I’d except you have to swipe up. So if you just start swiping up as you hold the phone to your face, boom! Instant unlock",YouTube
5881,Face ID works 101% for me under any conditions. I am so used to it now that i don't even think about it...just pick up the phone and swipe up. Also you don't have to actually LOOK at the phone...you may as well be looking elsewhere.,YouTube

5894,"I'll wait for the S9. Probably around £350 cheaper, larger screen, nicer looking and better hardware.",YouTube
5895,you say that the screen is the best is the world haaaahahaha do you research before you review somthing...do you really think samsung is going to give them the best screen in the world.beside that...apple just made an exucuse FOR THEIR SCREENS! that the look  to blue from an angle and burning(somthing an oled screen can do)...and dont give me that bs..that apple has changed the screen to make it better NO  the dont...the give it a different nam and boom the sheeps are foold... if you look up the factual specs of the x it losses big time in al directions...but hey its an apple.....right (fools),YouTube
5896,"Man this is the best no-nonsense iPhone X review ever. No boring bits that we already know, like how the notch can take some getting used to, or making a big deal about Animojis or trying to fool Face ID by dressing like clowns. Keep up the great work!",YouTube

5920,The number 1 reason I hate my iPhone X is because ? boring software. The software is so dull and bland,YouTube
5921,If I want an absolutely amazing camera i'll just buy an actual camera the phone that i have is affordable and the camera is good enough for me screw apple i've never been a fan i've never been convinced now if i got it free somehow that'd be a different story. But i'd probably sell it lol idk.,YouTube
5922,How fast does the iphone x charge?,YouTube
5923,i picked up a 256 X in silver today. when i was talking on it after setting it up something kept pulling on my sideburns and beard and i thought it was some sticker schmutz leftover from the front and back glass wrap. but it was the sharp edges where the glass meets the metal! they were so rough that shit was grabbin my hair. i checked a few forums and yupp. lots of people complaining about build and screens. screw you apple. it goes back tomorrow. between that and ios 11 i'm literally done. i'll be looking into an 8+ or a note 8. or even a v30.,YouTube

5926,"I agree with you that the blacks are too black when watching movies.  The dark areas show very little gray scaling so that the shadows are generally dark, even when turning up the brightness which only causes noise in the video.  Other than that the screen is awesome.",YouTube

5930,This phone is underwhelming for the money. For $1000 it should have AMAZING battery life. Super durability. Maybe something cool like a projector. A pair of updated headphones and absolutely a headphone jack.,YouTube

I bought a 2017 non-Google flagship (LG G6) after my Nexus 5 died, and immediately when setting up my account I was told my Google cloud storage had been updated with 100 GB extra(!). With that price tag they should at least give you a lot or unlimited storage for multimedia, cause Apple is really behind Google on the services front and don't seem to see it. With Google you get unlimited storage for Photos auto backup if you agree to let them scale down the image to a still totally OK resolution which still looks great with an awesome camera like my G6 has. Though I upload full size since I have so many GBs.",YouTube

5940,£1000 for a phone lol,YouTube
5941,It’s like Audi is helping Mercedes build a really nice future car that we were all thinking about which is the the iPhone 10,YouTube
5942,Can you make a video to lobby Apple to make the phone unlockable by looking at it and then blinking or some kind of facial expression of your choice rather than having to swipe up.  Wouldn't that be totally amazing?  Should be easily doable with a firmware update.,YouTube
5943,Man how much has 3 and apple had paid you to this video  For the price you pay for this phone you need to get everything right  The screen burns looking at it at the sides you see a blue colour  Theirs more things wrong with it so be fair with bad points as well,YouTube
5944,Thank Samsung world because without them  they wouldn't have that screen.,YouTube

5951,do the review and stop complaining about the price,YouTube
5952,"Apart from the display which is amoled and not super amoled, and the true depth camera sensor, there is nothing different. It's just the same grid of iOS with a few software changes. I'm waiting for the Galaxy s9 plus.",YouTube

5955,"Samsung, with its ""Video Enhancer"" feature, has solved the issue of dark areas in movies/videos being crushed when you view them in daylight.  It's definitely one of my favorite features on Samsung smartphones – among several other very handy features, like Always-on Display, color profiles, etc. ; and it works in all videos apps!

5959,Hate iPhone 8 as much as I Love X !!,YouTube
5960,The  iPhone x is overcomplicated to use and it goes against one of the most important things that Apple used to differentiate (iOS)  then from Android.  Anyways if someone payed $1k + for this new iPhone he better get used to the OS .But then don't come tell Android users that the iPhone X is more intuitive and easier to use. LOL,YouTube
5961,Android fans are poison. They are such a pain the butt. If you dont like iPhone then why come here and spews your venom!,YouTube

6011,So nobody is gonna bring up the fact that in order to replace the back glass is pretty much half of the phones cost?,YouTube
6012,Your hairline top notch comparison was hilarious hahhaa,YouTube
6013,During all ur review u just talked about getting used to the thing even if it's not consistent. Come on man,YouTube
6014,"I’ve had the iPhone X for two weeks now and I honestly kind of wish I had just kept my iPhone 7. It’s not a terrible phone but there are a few things that kind of aggravate me about it.   The first thing being accessing the control center is more difficult because pulling down from the top right is just ever so out of reach without adjusting your grip; same can be said of trying to pull down notifications. You can turn on the accessibility feature that lets you reach it more easily but I don’t feel like the gesture to access it is reliable enough. In general iOS11 doesn’t really feel like it was made with iPhone X in mind.  Second would be, I know it’s still early but not many apps have iPhone X support yet rendering your added screen space useless for the most part.  Third I just don’t feel like Face ID works as well as the fingerprint sensor does.  A couple good things I like about it..  For one the screen does look good as has been said. I have a love/hate relationship with the notch though.  Another thing I noticed the first time I took a call on it was the voice coming through the earpiece sounds A LOT better than the 7 did.  Being able to take 4K 60fps video is pretty awesome.  Overall I really can’t recommend the phone sadly, it isn’t really worth it. Maybe the next iteration of the X will be better.",YouTube
6015,"Hold up Hold up, you said it can finally rival the Samsung screens? lol that is a Samsung screen so the only way to rival it is to creat there one.",YouTube
6016,Simply not worth the money,YouTube

6023,"classic reason why to avoid visiting the US: with opinionated vapid heads like that prancing around, it's no wonder that everyone hates the U.S! This ego queen is hard to satisfy because his grudges keep rising to the surface...  The X is vastly superior to anything Android has tossed on the market! Iris recognition works seamlessly; on the Galaxy S8+, by comparison, I needed to turn *ALL* the safety features off, for *none* of them work properly!",YouTube

6033,he says thank you to a bigger screen...... pays too much for it,YouTube
6034,"Apple didn't put a 3D touch home button because if they did you wouldn't be able to 3D touch links and pictures at the bottom of the phone, then the news would be all over it going: ""MAJOR FLAW: VIRTUAL HOME BUTTON INTERFERES WITH 3D-TOUCHING LINKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE IPHONE X"".",YouTube

6036,0:27 I told them airplane mode actually made you fly.,YouTube
6037,"The only reason why I didn’t buy an Iphone X, was that terribly looking notch on that amazing screen... it just looks so bad that I wonder how their concept developer even came up with it in the first place. Guess Ill go with the S9",YouTube
6038,iPhone 8 Plus > iPhone X NO QUESTION,YouTube
6039,"I find it so hilarious that people think the ""no home button"" is so cool and useful on this iPhone X. I the fact people are ""learning"" something new with its gestures. ""Swipe up to get to home....swipe up then right to your recently open apps"" Wow. So intuitive, right? It's 2017 right?  Well let's take a walk down memory lane. Back in 2013 BlackBerry is introduced BlackBerry 10 OS or BB10. Their phone was the z10 with no ""home button"" . People back then thought ""what a dumb move by RIM"" . BlackBerry never took the simple idea of seeing a new way of ""getting back to home"" . I still use one of those devices, Z30 (z10 bigger brother) and when I compare it side by side with the iPhone X, I can truly tell you how optimized BB10 is way back in 2013. With the hardware back then in 2013 is still better in so many ways then the current 2017 iPhone X with its Bionic 11 chipset. It's so sad people were and still closed minded. Also here's a fun fact. Apple hired the team who developed the BlackBerry 10 OS and guess what.....its now running you $1300 iPhone.  Cheers. BlackBerry has taken over you Apple isheep. Suck on these NUTZ",YouTube
6040,I am afraid that this phone maybe just a “see what the rats will do” experiment. It is very hard to swallow the lack of Touch ID and the mediocre battery. Apple could of hit it out of the park and included both. Only time will tell if this was a brilliant move or not. My 7plus really is the phone that has it all. Oled is cool but not enough to change my whole use dynamic.,YouTube
6041,What an incredibly irritating review.,YouTube
6042,best part is the screen... FUN FACT is made by SAMSUNG is obvious that is amazing,YouTube
6043,Still staying with my iPhone 6 for now. Going to order a new battery and repair kit and add a glowing apple logo to it soon. It still works so I don't need to change yet. Would I like an iPhone X? Yes I would but I'm not buying it yet.,YouTube
6044,I have the x and the 8 plus. The X isn’t all that hype. I’m using the 8 plus more,YouTube
6045,"Kinda funny that my mother who is 71, who has used Android for years, takes one look at an iPhone and asks, ""There's no back button? No way.. No thanks."" If you need a button to operate a smartphone then I don't think you should be using a smartphone because chances are you can't think for yourself and are unintelligent. Oh wait, that makes perfect sense why so many people buy Apple products. Silly me, I'm dumb.",YouTube

6056,"I highly recommend that you do NOT use wireless/bluetooth headphones. Believe it or not, they actually make you more likely to get brain cancer, and just are not good for your health in general.

I'll say it one time, there are literally almost NO BAD SMARTPHONES ON THE MARKET. Just about Every phone your run into is a good phone. All of the high end galaxies or iPhones are nothing but useless gimmicks meant to entertain the masses. So to all the android and Apple fanboys, please just buy your phone, shut up and stop shitting on other brands. Your phone is not special and your life is still gonna suck afterwards.",YouTube

6087,Charging £1000 for a phone and not including the quick charger in the box is the most Apple thing ever.,YouTube
6088,"ALRIGHT PEOPLE, LISTEN: or no, no, read :P I've got the iPhone X since day one and i played a bit with it and i love it! I don't miss the home button (at all), i really don't, the swiping is so so fast and convenient, once you try it you will love it!  Face ID is blazing fast, you don't realize it to be honest. you just take your phone out and swipe up and that's it. I understand a lot of people are scared for the notch and it's not the most beautiful design element, but once you look at the screen the notch actually disappears, (unless in landscape mode of course), but it's not bad at all. The only thing i can say is: if you have an Apple store nearby, just go and check it out. :-)",YouTube
6089,I can't see the notch being around for future models.,YouTube

6093,You can still flick away an app to close it after it is in the “kill app” mode?,YouTube
6094,"You see the problem for Apple / iOS users is there is nowhere else to go. So they have to convince themselves this is a better phone than what preceded it. If this were an Android phone, it would be said to have the following flaws -  1. No headphone jack. 2. There's a huge chunk missing from the display. You would not buy a TV or Monitor with a notch, why is it ok on a phone? They didn't have to do this, they could have engineered around it. It's a branding exercise. 3. Largest and tallest camera bump on an iPhone (ever) and asymmetrically placed for wobble 4. Fragile, compounded by $500 repair costs, so needs a case. 5.less ergonomically efficient biometric unlocking (they could have added touch ID on the back). 7. Still heavy/pronounced bezels 8. and all these compromises can be yours for $1000 ($1100) if you want fast charging. Expensive and cynically so. Seems like it's fundamentally flawed on many levels. Each of those causes the customer pain, workarounds or the need to explain it all away. It's a cool piece of technology, sure. But it is still flawed in ways that seem to be covered up by the reality distortion field that surrounds Apple tech. When there is no alternative, objectivity fails.",YouTube

Yes I know you love this phone you keep always praising it even the price agains the others.  Would be nice to have a non bias review emphasis on non bias instead of making excuses and how its all so hoorah for the iX blah blah blah.

I don’t think so, just compare portrait side by side and the crazy dynamic range of FFC from pixel, it just blows IPhone X out of the water, no doubt iPhone X is a good phone but can’t justify the price tag and that’s just my opinion. Camera lump is another pain.",YouTube

Frankly it looks like a shiny toy for apes and will break at the first drop, guaranteed. So where is the reviewer with the balls to call Apple`s BS and recommend a loud and clear no-buy?",YouTube

6139,"...If I had a choice between the iPhone X and the Note 8, I'd choose the Note, because I once owned a beat-up, hand-me-down Note 3 and used the crap out of it for a wide variety of tasks (from photo and sound editing to music creation and social networking) until it finally died... That's another thing - If I had started the smartphone thing with iOS, I'd probably go in succession with another iOS phone over the years whenever the previous one died (I'm a single-handset owner creature of habit), but I've got too much money, blood, sweat, and tears invested in Android to want to switch now!",YouTube

6151,i picked up a 256 X in silver today. when i was talking on it after setting it up something kept pulling on my sideburns and beard and i thought it was some sticker schmutz leftover from the front and back glass wrap. but it was the sharp edges where the glass meets the metal! they were so rough it was grabbin my hair. i checked a few forums and yupp. lots of people complaining about build and screens. screw apple. it goes back tomorrow. between that and ios 11 i'm literally done. i'll be looking into an 8+ or a note 8. or even a v30. thanks for your awesome reviews.,YouTube
6152,nice review.....,YouTube
6153,8:40 lol,YouTube
6154,"The main problem with the application closer is apple  advertised it wrong. They put on the website you have to move your finger up and hold it. This is very slow. If you move your finger up and to the right, it will immediately open - being practically instant. This is poor choice on their part like most of the phones release.",YouTube

6237,i prefer B L A C K B E R R Y,YouTube
6238,"I think the face id does have a problem regarding the face recog thing in real life situations is it is just plain cumbersome and not entirely appealing to need to stare down at your phone screen and keep still for a second than just using your fingers for a pattern. ( you have to use your fingers anyway to swipe up). Fingerprint sensor makes more sense to me. But still even though I have fingerprint sensors I do not use it( entirely my preference)...since I tend to feel myself unlocking it by entering a pin or pass or a pattern is something I am doing( proactively) while the other cases I expect the sensor and phone to act reactively.   Using the face id in winter is sure going to be fun though...when you need to take off your woolen monkey caps and stuff,look at the phone and then put them back on. I doubt how many people would actually use this to unlock the phone. ( I myself use a samsung note series for long..but I am well aware of both apple and samsung being highly overpriced piece of tech( and samsung even does not support two years old phones with updates..shame on them)...so I am not biased against apple for my love of samsung.) However this can be an additional option to unlock the phone..adding to the convenience while the main method of unlocking remains the hands.",YouTube

6466,"This phone is overhyped. It has a bad fingerprint scanner placement, unfinished Bixby software, lag already even with SD835 meaning it is not optimised, a camera that takes good but not the best photos, so so battery life when set to QHD (as it should be instead of a default FHD....such rubbish). Then Android people complain Apple is only using FHD yet don't care when Samsung defaults to FHD or would've slammed LG if the fingerprint scanner was badly placed or if the battery was small. So much double standards. Besides the looks and good screen there is nothing noteworthy about this phone.",YouTube
6467,Way better than x,YouTube
6468,Why oh why is the Bixby button active when the phone is locked? If you press the button when the screen is locked the screen turns on and unlocks Bixby........ WHY!?!??? Talk about battery drain if you pocket puches the button all the time!,YouTube

6504,I bought my S8 at Best Buy for $420! Which I think is an amazing price for this phone. It wasn't unlocked but I didn't need it to be so that wasn't a big deal to me. I've had it just over a week and I am very happy so far with its performance. I personally believe it's the best phone I've owned to date. I did find the fingerprint sensor slightly challenging in the beginning but I've adapted to it now. However I will say coming from a phone with a bigger battery has been noticeable to me. I easily get through a normal day with fairly heavy usage but I do worry how that will hold up 6 months or a year down the line. But all in all it's a great phone and I have no regrets!,YouTube

However, I dropped my Galaxy S8 once and luckily because I had a cover, its glass didn't break, but since then the rear camera is almost always blurry and I have to knock on the screen to make the blurring go away. Additionally, I have noticed that some apps tend to crash more on Samsung Galaxy S8 than on my previous phone which was an iPhone. But this is something Android related, I guess.",YouTube

And can slip out of pockets and hands if really oily(<Is that a word, idk?) but there are cases to protect this phone. The finger print scanner is fine in my opinion.

6540,dBrand need to cut these sponsorships now. They are getting very candid and quite obviously an advert. And the amount they are paying per video won't be getting them any increase of brand awareness over and above what they already have.

6547,"I heard that it gets seriously hot when you have the brightness on full.  Have you noticed that?  I didn't like the S7 because of the speaker, the camera flaws, and the stutter and lag.  By the stellar reviews I thought that Samsung must have ironed those problems out in the S8, but I guess I was just watching biased con job videos that are probably paid for by Samsung (we know their integrity is lacking).",YouTube

6549,"To my surprise, the S8 has been  a major winner. Little glitching,  no lag and No slowening'. Bixby assistant has been amazing ( a little slow), fantastic pictures, genius audio routing. I have no issues with the finger print sensor. Iris unlocking works  great. Coming from Apple, S6, S7, Nexus 6P this has been the best phone I have ever used when combining all the features it provides. In addition, I have given up on many Google apps to give the Samsung versions a try to see how well bixby assistant can help. Overall it's been good.

Like telling Bixby to open YouTube, search for say Resident Evil Necroscope86, and play first video or open first playlist and it will do it.  My thoughts on Samsung's 2017 flagships to me the best phone of 2017 is the Note 8 second place would be the S8 Plus. I have the S8 Plus reason for picking it up instead of the Note 8 is well it brought my phone bill down and saved me money. Plus even though the Note 8 is better I found that there just wasn't enough extra features to entice me to get it maybe next year I'll go with the Note 9 or maybe I'll just stick with the S line for a while.",YouTube

Its not meant to compete with Ok Google, Siri or Cortana for that matter.  You'd be comparing apples to oranges.  Learn what something can do before you start knocking it.

6581,"I actually have s8 since last month and i really enjoy it, its big, right but the fingerprint button is such a nerving thing for me cuz sometimes it works properly and sometimes not, and it has a bad spot so thats - for me. But display is just wow, cant say more because display is godly level and its so beautiful. Up to camera, its sharp and really great in making normal photos or selfies so im amazed. But the worst thing is the durability when dropped, its so thin glass you need to watch out for it, it can crash really easy so hold it tight in your hands and dont let to drop this phone. This is my first samsung in my life because i have mostly used sony xperia phones and thats my first flagship phone too, after i started my work career i was able to purchase one s8 too and until now im really happy with this phone. I rate this phone 9/10 because the only one - is the fingerprint button. If you want this phone, then buy it cuz its worth it.",YouTube

So why do you keep saying the S8 now shoots in 2K on the front facing camera, when I've been VLOGGING IN 2K for the last 2 plus years? ???...all things considered the new S8+ spec wise is a beast!

6610,"I've been an apple phone user for a while now, and I've got to say that I was impressed by this phone, enough to make me want to buy it. What turned me off android before was the claim that the google play store doesn't contain as many good apps and games as the App Store because of piracy and other concerns. I do know piracy is still quite prevalent in IPhones, but IOS being a closed OS makes this a bit harder. Does the Google play store really miss many good apps and games? Or is it blown out of proportion by Pro-Apple sites?",YouTube

6614,"Great video, love long in depth reviews to go with my bowl of cereal, but just one thing about the battery, yes it has more pixels and the screen is advertised as being larger, but because of the new aspect ratio the screen area hasn't changed by a whole lot. And I think you should have mentioned that the processor is now made on a 10nm platform, unlike the 14nm of the previous gen which makes it a lot more efficient, so that increase battery life even though they haven't made the battery bigger.",YouTube

6617,"Hey, I thought the video was very good and gave a well rounded opinion. The only problem I have as a viewer and subscriber of your channel is that you and every other tech YouTuber aren't giving the Bixby assistant a chance. I believe the point of the video was to review the phone in it's entirety. I want to know more about Bixby assistant and see if it may actually be more useful to me based on how I use my phone.

6652,"What I've learned over the years is that neither a Samsung Galaxy phone or an Apple iPhone ""sucks"". They both have awesome specs and features and if you're able to afford one, you're already living better than people in third world countries who can't afford food to eat, clean clothes, and shoes to wear. What it all comes down to is brand loyalty. If you've enjoyed a certain brand for a long amount of time, you're not gonna switch over to the other competitive brand, more often than not, unless you want to try it just to say you did. It's really all about personal preference. So there's no need to throw hate or shade over which smartphone is better, because they're both fantastic and if you have either one, you're doing alright in life and have no need to complain.",YouTube

I like the small phone that fits nicely in my pocket, but I would like the slightly better battery life and screen real-estate.   It's slightly pissing me off that this is such a difficult choice to make between the two. I don't plan on upgrading again for a few years, so I don't wan to make the wrong choice. Darn it",YouTube

6759,"I own the S8 ! It's better than last generation. Performance and camera are similar to S7 and S7 Edge. The things which are new are Bluetooth, display,iris, and gorilla glass. The AKG Earphones are so better than I expected and feel premium.  There's also no camera bump behind. If your getting a good deal for less than 650$ than go for it. It will be worth it.  I think it will be more better for s6 edge or previous generation  users because they'll feel a lot new going on !  There's one thing you should keep in mind. S8 display is great and big but it's won't let you feel too big, If you like to use bigger screen than  go for the S8+ Both devices are futuristic and dope.",YouTube

6842,"Wah saya juga baru hijrah lagi ke Android dan pilih si S8 Maple Gold ini, baru pemakaian 3 hari jadi belum bisa kasih penilaian penuh. Jadi emang salah satu minusnya ada di letak fingerprint sensor yang menyulitkan bgt. Trus tombol Bixby yg bikin salah pencet, padahal maksudnya mau kecilin volume. Trus auto brighteness suka terang redup dg spontan tanpa ada penyesuaian perlahan, apalagi switching antar aplikasi kamera/youtube, berasa bgt tuch. Trus mode tone color layarnya over saturated padahal udh pake mode Amoled Photo. Bodynya cukup licin, apalagi kalo tangan berkeringat, cepet berminyak, solusinya serin2 aja nih hp dimandiin....;) Overall dibalik segala kekurangannya lumayanlah worthed bgt dg segudang fiturnya yg melimpah",YouTube

6888,"OK deh bang sy ngikut, stay di S7 EDGE ??",YouTube
6889,ngelagnya menurutku karena beberapa game belum mendukung GPU mali terbaru dari CPU exynos.. ini sempet dibahas di beberapa media teknologi.. jadi ya tunggu update software buat atasi hal itu .. kalau versi Snapdragon sih lancar lancar aja.   cuma ya isu terbaru katanya UFS storagenya pakai yang 2.0 bukan 2.1 seperti yang dipresentasikan pertama kali.. hemm jadi kalau upgrade ke S8 dan kamu masih punya S7 dan S7 edge.. mungkin harus bersabar dulu..,YouTube

6901,Bang Wallpaper nya cari dimana ?,YouTube
6902,"untuk bixby, ane rasa Samsung terburu buru dalam mengerjakannya, karena baru terdengar rumornya setelah Google Assistant diluncurkan. soal fingerscan samsung katanya udah menyerah bikin sensor di dalam layar, dan katanya bakal lanjut lagi dan bakal di pasang di Note 8. Dan kedua hal itu yang ane rasa kurangnya lumayan mengganggu di S8, sisanya seperti rasio layar kan bisa diakali",YouTube
6903,bener bang saya baru pake 3 minggu udh agak lemot,YouTube
6904,"yah mungkin banyak aplikasi ga supprt sama layarnya s8 yang rasionya mungkin agak ""aneh"" ya soalnya rasio segitu jarang dipake sama smartphone merk lain(kecuali g6)tapi kalo menurut saya mah sih worth it banget, kalo ada duit pun rencana beli s8,inget dari hp itu kita butuh USER EXPERIENCE bukan pamor SPESIFIKASI/SKOR ANTUTU.",YouTube

6932,"Hape multimedia? mungkin bisa dibilang setengah multimedia karena SOT cuma 4.5 jam?? TIDAAAKKKKKKK Buat sosmed dan gaya-gayaan jelas oke banget. Kamera sip, desain seksi. Tapi buat hard gamer, atau casual gamer? Totally NOT. Kalau ak punya S8 ini paling buat motret-motret doang. Main game tetep pakek redmi. Karena pengalaman pakek Redmi yg batrenya 4000mAh lebih, yang 10% batrenya bisa buat 1 jam SOT. Kemudian ganti hape flagship yang syukur-syukur 15% batrenya tembus 1 jam SOT. Pasti bakal langsung down dan was-was.",YouTube

6975,ada bajet kemaren utk s8+ tapi dipikir2 dan di pertimbangkan.  so..untungnya kemaren ambilnya S7 edge aja. lebih enak aja. lagian ada uang sisanya buat shoping. toh utk kls S7 edge masih kerenn bangettt utk lahir batinnya. tombol finjernya juga lebih simple membahana,YouTube
6976,"Bixby useLESS !! bahahahaha Google Now, Google Assistant, and Siri better than Bixby.. seriously ! bahahahaha samsung suck",YouTube
6977,"Pendapatnya sangat setuju Bang, saya juga user S7 Edge dan Xperia Z3+ Jika dilihat dari perkembangan yang ada hanyalah upgrade minoritas, dan jika berbicara mengenai GAME dan aplikasi, processor yang digembar-gemborkan tercepat saat ini nyatanya harus tetap bersanding dengan yang lama seperti Snap 625, 801, 810 maupun 821 karena masih sama² mampu menjalankan aplikasi² yang ada saat ini dengan kemampuan yg tak jauh beda. . dari segi kamera, mungkin XZ P dan XZs layak dipertimbangkan karena super slow adalah inovasi yg luar biasa untuk saat ini di ranah ponsel namun di sisi lain seperti design  malah menurun jika dibanding Z series, terutama Z3+ dan Z5 / Z5 P sementara S7 edge ke S8 hanya sedikit pembenahan. . Keputusan untuk upgrade dari S7 ke S8 hanya karena mengejar gengsi, atau karena senang dg hal² yg baru Namun bagi yg belum punya flagship, cukup logis dan layak untuk mencoba sensasi yang berbeda, yang penting semangat nabungnya. ?",YouTube

7001,"I've had an iPhone for so long and I've started to grow out of them, mainly because the fucking design is the same each year only things that change are the cameras. With android software you get so much more freedom compared to apples locked in software; that is if you jailbreak, which to me has as well became very dull and hated! So yes I've saved up enough money from working at publix to get this phone and its time  to have a real phone go fuck yersulf Steve jobs ur ded!!!",YouTube
7002,Honestly I thought S8 would finally be a competition to the iPhone's camera..,YouTube
7003,"I like the iPhone 7's video quality more but prefer the photo quality on the S8, also S8's audio recording seems to be a lot better. ;p",YouTube
7004,honestly simply because it has small bezels doesn’t matter to me!! i still think that ios is much better than android which is a complete mess!! also i dont care about the headphone jack i haven’t used it since 2014,YouTube
7005,"What really amazes me always and kept me asking myself is this, when will Casey ran out of unique ideas?

7025,How is it possible 12 megapixel cmos record 4k video,YouTube
7026,I believe that's the Note 8 and not the S8... it took me a while to realize that. I was wondering why he was making such a late review.,YouTube

7055,Stop banging them off the table mate. Jesus christ.,YouTube

7079,"The wallpaper was created by our graphic designer, William Joel. We're doing a Facebook Live on Thursday 4/20 at 11AM EST to show how he made it.  Until then you can download it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nl3rsnbfm9u2etw/Verge_S8_Review_Wallpaper.jpg?dl=0",YouTube
7080,Should have included the bluetooth 5.0 part. This is the first phone on the planet with bluetooth 5.0,YouTube
7081,"Who started the trend of saying ""this is best xyz that this company has ever made?""  Obviously. It'd be unacceptable if a company came out with a new model of something that's worse than last year's.  Such a stupid phrase that people and companies need to stop saying.",YouTube
7082,17$ for bananas ?!?!?!? That's BANANAS !!!!,YouTube
7083,man this phone looks GORGEOUS.  Doesnt matter if u like iOS or Android.  credit where credit is due.  This phone is a home run by Samsung.,YouTube
7084,"Review pros and cons:  Pro: Glad that discussion about hardware specs (internals, cameras, etc.) was short and sweet. It's a good thing for the tech industry in general when someone can post a review that says ""Everything works great, as you would expect."" There is a reason we no longer talk about things like call quality in reviews anymore, and that's because things just work. Mobile technology continues it's strong forward momentum.  Cons: We get it. Samsung's? Note 7 exploded. Please, bring that up in every phone review for the next two years. I'm surprised Apple didn't get a jab about the headphone jack. Perhaps we can bring up Blackberry, too.",YouTube
7085,kinda overused the explosion joke in this one dontcha think?,YouTube
7086,"The Verge's videos have great visuals, editing, and audio choice but the quality of their review content is not the best",YouTube
7087,People seem to overlook that it was like 0.0002 percent of note 7s that exploded.,YouTube
7088,New star wars trailer bruh,YouTube
7089,"nice video, ur videos are really good quality. I bet this will convince my parents to buy me this phone.",YouTube
7090,"Is it only me who never miss any tech reviews from MKBHD,Android Authority,Verge,Saf,..........but never got one for more than 2yrs due to less kidney and using cheap crap!?",YouTube

7092,Now is the time to end apple's monopoly.,YouTube
7093,it does not have the same camera it has a new sensor for gods sake before making a video atleast do some research. and those who gonna bash me well check erica griffin she will have ur answer to the camera question,YouTube
7094,Nice job to whoever filmed this video! Every shot is beautiful,YouTube
7095,Still waiting for a verge video without an apple reference,YouTube

7097,I want that background you have on the phone where can I get it from. Somebody help,YouTube
7098,its is not the same camera... get your hardware info right,YouTube
7099,Wallpaper on the phone?,YouTube
7100,"""Will it explode"" is not what everyone's thinking.  That happened once from Samzung because of a specific battery supplier from the positive and negative cells reaction when making contact.  Videos on You tube for the last month showed it is not the case.  You can drill a hole in the battery while charging and nothing happens.",YouTube
7101,it's truly sad how many mistakes there are in this video,YouTube
7102,wow you wasted 3 min of my life and this video trying to be funny with your lame exploding jokes dude get over it already ...and no I want subscribe,YouTube
7103,just returned to this video to redownload the wallpaper now that I have my S8 ?,YouTube
7104,"As I thought... the Verge complains about the price of S8. Dude, even here in Australia S8 price is the same as base model of iPhone 7. Let that sink in...",YouTube
7105,What's the Snapchat quality??,YouTube
7106,yes finally made the decision to leave Apple...pre ordered my s8..reakky can't wait?,YouTube
7107,I'm definitely going to be enjoying my S8Plus on Friday.,YouTube
7108,"I'm pretty sure the only people that care that much about the Note 7 exploding are people that had their Note 7 blow up, which was a very small group of an already small group of owners that had the device. It's not that big of a deal.",YouTube
7109,4:30 how did his notification pop up like that?,YouTube
7110,Actually there is an app i can't really remember it's name that enables you to map the bixby button to 2 or 3 apps based 1 or 2 clicks or long click,YouTube
7111,When The Verge doesn't do their homework on the fact that the phone uses a new sensor.,YouTube
7112,Your voice is ridiculous.,YouTube
7113,The design looks the same the only thing they did is make the screen bigger and round corners,YouTube
7114,The s8 is a great looking device. But i'm still keeping my s7 edge. Still a solid device that is even better on nougat. And yes we get it... Note 7 was big setback for Samsung. We don't need to hear this mentioned in future Samsung reviews.,YouTube
7115,my sister has always been apple fan and when her daughter through the iphone in the toilet 3months ago and she lost everything. Her apple care was expired.  Gave her my back up old mint S5. she loves it and is now 'used to it'.  So shes getting the S8 Plus ASAP.,YouTube
7116,Things to love S8- 1. OLED screen 2. VIBRANT screen 3. SHARP screen 4. COLOURFUL screen 5. ALL GLASS design 6. BEZEL LESS screen 7. CURVED screen 8. EDGY design 9. TALL screen 10. SCREEN.,YouTube

7126,This review is like a music video/movie/documentary. Well done!!!!,YouTube
7127,I strongly regret buying this damned overpriced slippery damned phone!!!!!!!!,YouTube
7128,"I dont like the big screens, no edge, no buttons, curved edge phones. Keeping it to my iphone 5s for now.",YouTube
7129,Every other review says the iris scanner is pretty fast without having to hold the phone in awkward position,YouTube
7130,anyone know the name of the song/music starting at 1:15??,YouTube
7131,"""'All phones look the same,"" or to put it succinctly they all look like an iPhone! That said, it's very easy to notice the overall design improvements Samsung brought in this time around, one of the noticeable ones is to remove the ugly Samsung logo from the front to the back. Although, didn't quite understand why Samsung hasn't gone for the dual camera set-up here, while someone like Oppo managed to innovate wonderfully with their new 5x lens technology. No denying the fact this looks gorgeous, but still can't trust the Samsung skins - perhaps the ugliest ever interpretation of Android. Not sure worth putting so much money on a device, which would perhaps stop at only one Android update in its lifetime vis-a-vis guaranteed for a lifetime updates for iOS",YouTube
7132,You can change the Bixby button with the app bixbye and you can change it to whatever you want,YouTube
7133,why is this man talking about the note 7 when almost NO other reviewer is he must have a iphone somewhere in there....,YouTube
7134,even when they compliment they sound bad and cocky...,YouTube
7135,Excelente review! nuevo suscriptor.,YouTube
7136,how can it be a perfect phone.. or best phone... when it has that weird placement of the FP sensor... making sure people wont use it that much....  i'll bet my money on the iphone 8/7s .... if there is any company which can implement the onscreen FP sensor the correct way... its #Apple,YouTube
7137,"HOLD ON A SECOND! Software on the Note5 just got updated to Nougat. Right now, Note5 beats ALL the Galaxy S models. All of them. Including the S8.  I'll just wait for a new Note. it always... . . . blows me away",YouTube
7138,That's true. Sammy phones slow down so much after 6 months and battery suffer from it too mostly because of that amount of security paths it requests you to ALWAYS install. In a long-term it's not a good phone even liking this more by far than any iPhone but in the end I just need a better update-oriented-ecosystem as any iPhone. There's also some buyers getting trouble with those infinity diplays alleging it's getting red on the top.,YouTube
7139,"*He had to mention ""iPhone"" 4 times. FOUR TIMES.*",YouTube
7140,"Best phone? Nope, wait next 80 years, best phone, galaxy s88!",YouTube
7141,"Not as good as the iPhone 7, but I completely understand the hype for the design, it's new. By the way, the software is definitely a downside and will always be until an ad-hoc, fully optimized one is created (probably never, since both Samsung and Google care more about money than *long-term customer satisfaction*). Moreover, the hardware is too pumped and the device doesn't offer a great usage of it, which is shameful. This can be easily seen by the epic fail they've made with security, the fingerprint sensor is placed in a horrible position and, most importantly, the facial scanner is a complete scam: https://9to5google.com/2017/03/31/samsung-galaxy-s8-facial-recognition-security-questioned/  Moral of the story: don't let the hype make you choose to waste all your money for a smartphone that won't last more than 2 years. iPhones do last at least 4 to 5 years if used correctly, and i'm talking as a possessor of the 2012 iPhone 5, still fast enough for its age. Gonna probably switch to iPhone Edition later this September, it will probably be worth it.  There is a lot more to complain about Android by the way, but I don't want to appear as a cospiracy theorist.",YouTube
7142,that editing tho,YouTube
7143,Samsung is going to have the best camera in 2017 ??? Isn't that too soon to say ?,YouTube
7144,"Skip to 0:40 if you want to avoid the ""Here's a question everyone is thinking...but here's a non-answer because obviously we don't know"" segment.",YouTube
7145,"I always come back to this video. Lovely production, excellent sets, audio was good (almost musical). Only wished for more detail in stuff like camera and performance. By the way, is the background a home or studio or bar? Loved it!",YouTube
7146,I wasn't thinking that...,YouTube
7147,The presentation was fantastic,YouTube
7148,"Always loved apple, but Samsung and Microsoft really stepping up... Might just have to get this phone!",YouTube
7149,"The reason I'm only subscribed to MKBHD & Android Authority is this review, reviews from the verge always look great but they lack in substance, this felt hollow with things missing, some things weren't mentioned like Bluetooth, watching videos on this aspect ratio, wireless charging, new features that Samsung provides with its skin, pros & cons of this new screen, like when Apple came out with force touch some apps supported it & some didn't, so how does this screen handle apps that are out now, any news on apps embracing this ratio etc. One of the most dynamic features that's been introduced in years but no talk about its future or practicality. Disappointing.",YouTube
7150,0:27 dat Wallpaper on DAT screen! Amazing!!,YouTube
7151,"I have to say, MKBHD's review was better in my opinion.",YouTube
7152,at 5:00 Is that lag? really :/ There are things that will never change ........,YouTube
7153,what're the first & second songs?,YouTube
7154,"iPhone 6 bending: It's okay to talk abt it and poke fun.  Galaxy Note 7 catching fire: It's not okay and ppl should move on in life.   Why is it that, nowadays, it's okay to poke fun at Apple and not Samsung/Android.  Come on, if you can insult, don't bitch abt it when others do it to you.",YouTube

7182,"I've been on team apple my whole life. But im afraid apple let me down when it comes to the yearly upgrades, there is basically no difference between the 6s and 7.

7205,So how is the s8 plus gonna differ from the note 8 besides the s pen?,YouTube
7206,Is it only me who doesn't like the idea of removing the home button ? I liked it better when it actually had the home button at the front,YouTube

Pass, unfortunately.",YouTube

This is done by Samsung and soon (probably) apple.  -Bigger than 4 inch displays: I like my smart phone as a phone, not a 6 inch tablet. I genuinely think that both apple and     Samsung should run two lines of phones should be run, one small edition and one large one (kinda like they are now, but on a bigger scale. -Curved phones: Easier to drop, more to repair (made worse by glass backs) -Removal of good features: Apple has already removed their aux jack, but luckily our heroes Samsung have had the "" *Courage* "" to keep it. Mark my words they'll remove it soon, however. *Edit* I just realised Samsung removed the home button and replaced with with a worse one on the back. Not as bad as the removal of the headphone jack, it's still frustrating. -Untested phones: I like my phones not to blow up.  This is why I think my iPhone SE is the perfect phone for me.",YouTube

Apple has a lot to live up to in the Fall, but if current rumors are true it should be a pretty close battle. That being said, if you're not tied into the Apple ecosystem and are deciding between the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S8, pick the S8 or wait until the Fall and make a choice then. The S8 a much better phone than the iPhone 7. Of course it is. The iPhone is 6 months older, it doesn't have to be as good, just like how the S8 will not have to be as good as the iPhone X or 8 in the fall because it will be 6 months old by then.

7430,not a bad review however I think you over jumped the gun a bit find of the matter that you said that its like years ahead of us time is not necessarily fact  the fact the matter is yeah it is a good phone it yeah I might be better than  iPhones.  I have no doubt that this phone still has his flaws like for instance the battery still drains dramatically the voice reaction still doesn't react well enough. and to make things matters worse it's sometimes even crashes from time to time because it's trying to do so many things at once I understand that Samsung try to create something that was out of this world however they might have made a mistake by voicing a high-power computer into a tiny little device since it actually still has trouble functioning well because it's trying to do too many things at once now I'm not iPhone person I'm a Samsung some person but I'm just pointing out the facts. without a doubt it is a stunning phone however people never seem to point out the flaws in these things so this is the reason why I say that you kind of jumped the gun furthermore you really didn't actually stuck to your actually topic see on your title it says which one do you prefer that Samsung will the iPhone I was assuming that you were going to do a comparison of both but you may need just stick to one phone so it was more of a review,YouTube

I've got an S7 at present and fancy a change, but I'm always drawn to stock Android, based on much previous experience over the years.

7600,"Bixby is a typical Samsung move. They release a product that isn't even close to finished. And what about Samsung's ""worse in class"" RAM management.. It's hilariously bad and completely useless when trying to actually do something productive. I can't figure out why people are so hyped about this phone.",YouTube

7604,"2 months later... I've experienced over 5 repair attempts across 3 different S8 devices. (3 Verizon 2 by Samsung)  1st attempt =echo and no HD calling option possible. , got new replacement 4 days from purschase  2nd, dropped calls and slight buzzing, like earpiece speaker is blown.  2nd attempt = Verizon gives me refurbished device 20 days into new device plan (and 6 days after I couldn't get my old S6 back :(  3rd attempt = straight out of the box, earpiece speaker terrible and able to change buzzing when applying pressure to front or back of phone.  (I suspected a loose screw or adhesive failure)  4th repair = finally sent to Samsung (cause Verizon had no ability to fix anything, just swap one turd for another)  Ticket had 2x problems, dropped calls ongoing is sure across all 3 phones and buzzing from internal earpiece speaker.  Samsung replaced the fingerprint sensor and shipped my (now used, opened up and down for a total of 15 out of fist 30  days of new service and device plan.     Yes! Buzzing fixed although now the back isn't the same gap as the front, whatever, I got a case anyway......... Drop, drop, drop, drop one dropped call after another event dropping calls to both Verizon and Samsung while attempting to resolve the issue.   5th or 6th attempt, 2nd from  Samsung. Following items replaced   Battery, internal antenna (which is what I told Samsung originally along with attaching a message on paper to the phone itself for a technician to read.)  Motherboard and daughterboard      Finally, no dropped calls in 3 days, BUT NOW WITH A SCRATCH ON THE FRONT GLASS AND REAR GLASS STICKING AND COMING UNDONE WHEN TOUCHED.      SAMSUNG had an opportunity to retain me as a customer on several occasions.  They haven't so far only told me one thing, and did another.   Communication is a piss poor as the device (my own experience not reflective of the S8 world community)   Verizon could have helped more too but I am not pissed over the phone, they fucked up my billing so many times and tried to straight up rob me of money after having to show proof of their own mistakes.     Why can't I just get my startac back!",YouTube

7722,The only drawback I've heard so far about the 18.9 aspect is the video black bars. Seems trivial considering the many added benefits. Plus it's not a shortcoming of the hardware just a discrepancy in media formats. There was a time when 16.9 was new. Bummed they didn't add a second speaker tho. ,YouTube

7765,"A few questions from a current Apple user (who's never used any other platform) looking to switch:  1. I hate how in my music app if I close out the app it doesn't remember where I left off in a song or on a playlist. On the S8, if I close out the app, will the banner still be at the bottom, and will it remember what song I was playing?  2. I record music on my voice recorder app currently, and used to be able to add those songs into my music library. Now that I have Apple Music, it decides what music I can put in my library and what I don't if I have the iCloud Music option on. If I used a voice recorder app, could I add that in as a music file and listen to it like any other song?  3. Are there any apps that would allow you to add music that you have purchased in the past (my normal library), and stream music to download, all in the same app? That was my draw to using Apple Music before, as opposed to Spotify. I wanted to be able to listen to all of my music in the same app instead of switching back and forth from my library (purchased music) and streaming music. Does the Samsung Music app, or any other, allow you to do both?  Thank you very much for any feedback. God Bless and have great day!",YouTube

7796,"People, I would *AVOID* the iris scanner! The health warnings you get when you first set that shit up are NO JOKE. Looking a bit in to it you find out the IR light used to scan your IRIS is TERRIBLE for your eye and causes irreparable damage!   Samsung claims the IR scanner is safe because it will turn it self off after 9 seconds (after 10 you have irreversible damage to your eye) and that the sensor turns off when you hold it too close (also causes irreversible damage)    But how the FUCK do you trust that? I unlock my phone dozens if not hundreds a times a day! That has to do some fucking damage. Not to mention before I actually took the time to fully read & take serious the health warnings. While ""TESTING"" the IR scanner I used it for 5 to 10 minutes constantly back to back trying to see how fast, under what conditions etc. Now I'm worried I might have fucked with my eye (apparently it causes cataract, sight loss etc )  Even from the few days I did use it I am worried I might have caused serious damage to my eye :( staring in to the IR light etc   The face recognition is a lot less secure but works extremely fast and reliably from what I have tested. I would recommend people to use that instead. The IR scanner works from almost all angles from what I've tested but it's best if you hold the camera 20/30cm from your head, slightly open your eyes (which is kinda awkward in public) and it will recognize you under any conditions (the camera does have to be clean, even finger smudges makes it less accurate)   The face recognition also works under all conditions I tested, it works easier (just look at the phone and instant unlock) but is a lot less secure. I personally use finger print and face unlock now. I REALLY loved how well the Iris scanner worked after I learned how to properly use it (worked 99% of the time for me flawlessly after some testing, taking a good Iris scan etc) but the fact tat it ""MIGHT"" cause irreversable damage to my eye .. one of our most important if not our most importat ""sense"" I do no longer trust using it",YouTube
7797,"I bought before 3 months a galaxy s8, but after 3 months i can say that im sad about it. 3 single things that make me change a phone and return back to my old iPhone 6. 1- ?loatware. So many many apps that nobody NEVER uses, that they run background, using RAM and battery. (Awful) 2- Sensitive screen. Even if it will drop from a couch to the floor, then the screen is gonna break and im not kidding guys. This phone dropped by mistake from 10cm long couch and the screen cracked. 3. Lots of apps suddenly crash and the phone has begun to be way more laggy than the first week.  ---Sorry guys, but my previous phone (iPhone6) was faster, more reliable and more stable than this. I'm back to my iPhone6 now and im happier than before. I use this phone to my work and im feeling better than i used the S8 so in this point my quote is : Bettert hardware (?) on S8 but 100% better software in iPhone. Thanks for your time guys.",YouTube

7847,the s8 and s8+ seem to be fantastic phones in terms of performance and such but honestly that's not what it's about anymore. It's about the user experience now and the fact that you have so much bs preinstalled and have to resort to rooting and/or a custom rom to get rid of all the bloatware doesn't exactly scream good ux.

I love it. Oh, and also, the automatic brightness has changed from a preset algorithm, to one that learns. Where you manually place the brightness in a certain light level, it will return to when again in that light level again. Works great for me. But you do have to teach it first.",YouTube

7913,"The finger print is really comfortable to use , did you even actually use the phone for 30 days ? i have my finger print on my friends iphone and it almost always fails for my finger i dont know why ,plus it also has a limit to the times you can try to unlock while on the samsung which rarely gives me problems i can just keep tapping. Also how is it uncomfortable? i just pull it out of my pocket and i already have my finger on the scanner i open it and move on it's not like i have to keep pressing it while im using it.",YouTube
7914,"I got s7 a year ago. Its the worst phone i have ever used. My apps keeps crashing, i cant watch videos on instagram, etc. The only good thing is the image quality and battery life.",YouTube

7924,S6 is still better ...,YouTube
7925,I will never get another samsung. It takes forever for the latest update to come out since I use verizon and by the time I get it I am already outdated. I might wait for the pixel 2 to come out for my next phone.,YouTube

7939,"Most honest fucking review ever (Just some highlights. Watch this video homies you won't regret it LOL): - ""Man Samsung did some weird shit this time around"" - ""Some people have claimed that the black version doesn't show fingerprints as easily. *Looks Away*. Yeah that's bullshit"" - ""Got the volume rockers on the right along with that retarded Bixbi button"" (Bruh I died on this one LMAO) -  ""Google looking at you. God dam Motherfu****s"" - ""Speaking of useless features, Samsung, as they do every year, has packed the S8 to the Tits with software features that 90% of users will try once and never use again"" HAHAHAA - 5:41 He even cracked up here LOL - The ending is self explanatory HAHA",YouTube

7951,Opinions on upgrading from Galaxy S6 Edge to this? Is it worth it?,YouTube
7952,"A few questions from a current Apple user (who's never used any other platform) looking to switch:  1. I hate how in my music app if I close out the app it doesn't remember where I left off in a song or on a playlist. On the S8, if I close out the app, will the banner still be at the bottom, and will it remember what song I was playing?  2. I record music on my voice recorder app currently, and used to be able to add those songs into my music library. Now that I have Apple Music, it decides what music I can put in my library and what I don't if I have the iCloud Music option on. If I used a voice recorder app, could I add that in as a music file and listen to it like any other song?  3. Are there any apps that would allow you to add music that you have purchased in the past (my normal library), and stream music to download, all in the same app? That was my draw to using Apple Music before, as opposed to Spotify. I wanted to be able to listen to all of my music in the same app instead of switching back and forth from my library (purchased music) and streaming music. Does the Samsung Music app, or any other, allow you to do both?  Thank you very much for any feedback. God Bless and have great day!",YouTube
7953,Am not liking this phone very much I have to keep reseting my apps and my contacts don't have name's and I keep getting error on some apps,YouTube

8126,"I agree with you that s8 still the best smartphone on the market rightnow except for fingerprint scanner. I often misplaced my finger. So that's why I only used it for one week and switched to Google pixel. And for the optical image stabilisation I entirely free with you. Recording a video with s8 much better than iPhone and Google pixel. But for photo quaility, I think Google pixel is absolutely the winner here. In one night in a restaurant for having dinner. I challenge my friends whose iPhone 7 and s8. And the results are the photo taken by Google pixel way clearer than s8 while iPhone 7 photo is very bad, blurred and some over exposure of the light. Its true for photo in mid day, each of three phones produce good photos but when it is night. Google pixel camera gobbles the two phones",YouTube

8165,I will never buy the s8 + or even note 8 because I can not support the new ratio 18:9 it's really bad. I saw them in real life for compare with 16:9 and for me 16:9 is clearly better.,YouTube
8166,"does Samsung phone age well ? I have seen my friend using their Samsung phone for one year and complain it lags so often. I'm planning to get the s8 and not going to change my phone for 3-5 years as I'm a student , just wonder Samsung and the Android can hold up for long period of times .

8176,Im getting the iphone 8 soon because i like having a home button lol,YouTube
8177,Thumbnails always on point ?,YouTube
8178,"Honestly i was a bit disappointed with the iPhone x. The notch is going to be an annoyance for watching videos horizontally, its going to be cut out with every video. and i could care less about facial recognition, they should have implemented a home button into the screen with software much like every android device without a home button. the only good thing about the iPhone x is the the bezeless oled screen and still the notch is going to make videos look weird. am i taking crazy pills or is this not true???",YouTube
8179,where did you get that wallpaper? thx,YouTube
8180,E.R.I.C - Early Recognition Is Critical?,YouTube
8181,"I think IPhone 8/plus is good for still having the same design and screen because many people would still prefer having a home button or prefer the old design over edge to edge display, that's why Apple probably included iPhone 8/plus as an alternative. It's also good mention other than design and display the IPhone X and 8/plus are almost the same in every other aspect so I really like the fact that Apple did this. Also note that though a OLED screen will look much better than the already perfectly nice looking 1080p screen, at the end of the day it's a phone screen. Unless it's your main entertainment device, a fancy OLED screen is pointless on a phone because you'd be more focused on the functionality of it notice the sharp blacks. (I have used a Samsung phone, so I do know how an OLED looks) so buyers know that your only going to be paying extra $200 for an OLED edge to edge display... And that's about it. Furthermore if you have been using Apple you'd know there is a certain pattern, when the iPhone 4 came out it was great but the 4s was the same phone but so much better, same story with 5/5s 6/6s and now 7/7s which they call the 8, and with the X it's going to be a great phone but you know what's going to be even better the Xs. So if you aren't too bothered by display and design, please save your self some money and buy the 8 or even 7 which still holds up pretty well.",YouTube
8182,HOW DID HE HIDE THE CARRIER NAME IN iOS 11? Can someone please explain?,YouTube
8183,Of course... If Apple can make their smart watches to work with Android phones then am sure they would control the Smart Watch market.,YouTube

8424,"I must be in the minority, I've always liked the 6 design better than the 4 and 5. I also think the cream gold they got is pretty damn sexy now, didn't like it at first (owned a gold 6S and 7 plus) but it's really growing on me now. I can def see me rocking that with no case with a tan Tommy Hilfiger sweater and timbs, bouta look shaaaarp in October. Before you say get the X or the Note 8, me and my wallet aren't big fans of $1,000 plus anything. Biggest selling point for me is the speakers, 7 plus speakers were amazing.",YouTube

I kept breaking all my wired headphones and my wireless ones lasted three times as long as any wired ones I had. Give it up already.   In all fairness, Apple did it for money alone, but all the same, they had a point. Headphone jacks are outdated. Everyone should switch to USB type c for headphones and Apple should give up their proprietary junk. Death to the headphone jack.",YouTube

8448,"One thing i hate about these reviews is they always say ""if you have an iphone 6 then upgrade. if you have a 7, it's not worth it."" What about people who don't have any iphone?  I have a Galaxy s7 and it's starting to lag really bad. I wanted to try ios. So should i get the 8 or wait for the X?",YouTube
8449,"iPhone 8 is one of the stupidest things in the market. If you have a tight budget, buy iPhone 7. If you want a high-end phone, buy iPhone X.",YouTube
8450,You should have mentioned that quick charging doesn't come standard with the iPhone 8/8+. The 5 watt power adapter that comes with the phone isn't powerful enough for quick charging. You need to buy the 29 watt power adapter that costs $50. But that uses USB-C. So you also need to buy the USB-C to Lightning cable which is around $20. Those are all required to use quick charging on iPhones.,YouTube
8451,And here I am with my OnePlus 3 getting 70% battery in 30 minutes.,YouTube
8452,"Everyone are so opposed to new standards. Sure, apple didnt introduce face recognition, wireless charging, and bluetooth earphones, but apple is leading the migration to new standards. Face recognition been there for many years, but it has never been as secure and as fast as the one implemented by iphones. Apple pushes for the technology to be accepted as the new standard. So does like fingerprint, Apple didnt introduce it. Early implementation by android felt like it was just a gimmick and not considered safe. but apple it made so secure now its the standard and trusted. Wireless charging been around for years too, but has the implementation been that widespread? With iphone joining in the forces, you will see bigger impact it has in the society. How about earphone jack? With the implementation of wireless charging, you might or might not see the direction we are heading. Its towards wireless environment. Sure for now its absurd to see a phone without earphone jack, but in a few years, everyone will be moving towards wireless accessories, and earphone with wires will feel ""outdated"" and ""old"". From now on, you will see more and more technology towards wireless technology will be developed and implemented. And you know who started the movement.",YouTube

8478,"Asking about how I feel about the 8+.  I traded my 6+ for credit on Verizon account,  I think that is fair.  I struggled with do I upgrade,  I basically use the iPhone for GPS and chat,  the 6+ certainly handled that.  Out of the box,  yes it fells like 6+,  I upgraded because I could,  and not sure about iPhone X first release.  People complain about bugs and features,  but NO device manufacturer can produce a perfect product first time out,  it's the nature of the business to constantly refine hardware and firmware.  The average iPhone user would have NO idea what changes,  enhancements,  and functionality that comes with each reiteration.  I had no idea about the 3D touch, well many new features...  Thank you for the enormous time you've spent bringing us the features and areas for improvement,  which will always be present.  I am very satisfied now that I know what the iPhone 8 Plus can do.

8484,I upgraded from the 6s plus to the 8 plus. I find it to be so fast and the camera is amazing. I prefer the fingerprint unlocking which by the way is instantaneous compared to the 6s plus. In general the smart phones now are so powerful with great cameras and features it’s somewhat of an overkill..IMO for 95% of us it’s way more than we need; I can’t see myself upgrading again for another 4-5 years unless my iPhone has a major malfunction .,YouTube

I gotta say I´m really impressed with your channel, your reviews have a lot of knowledge of the product and technology in general  but without the too technical script others may have. Also its difficult not to notice the effort put in the recording and edition.

8577,The iPhone 8 Plus battery lasts a hour longer than the X. I just think the Plus has is better for power users and business. But the X is better for people that love to to text and take selfies.  https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/,YouTube

8583,My issue is the 720p screen on the original iphone.... honestly it's just an insult. Almost 99% of content is consumed in 1080p. Wake up Apple.,YouTube
8584,"No you weren't wrong, you're just surprised and it's better than you maybe expected.   - Charging is slow as fuck (wireless charging even slower). Yes it supports quick charging but they don't include the charger? What the fuck.  - Battery life sucks, especially using a *750p* display IPS LCD in 2017! *SEVEN FIFTY P DISPLAY*  - Same old design, this is literally what the iPhone 7 should've been  - NO reason this should be this expensive or more than the iPhone 7.   Just imagine this phone running android, would it get the same ""praise"" comparing it to manufacturers android  like Samsung and LG? Ofcourse not, because the phone literally sucks for 2017, yes it fast yes it has a good camera but this definitly isn't a 2017 ""flagship"" device and imo it shouldn't be priced like one.",YouTube
8585,"To be honest, I don't see a point having a wireless charging. You can't really get rid the cable because you still have to plug in the charger to the outlet anyway.",YouTube

Similar specs and all, and he got the fast charging cable with it. I'm shocked Apple would do this. I traded that for and LG G5. Unless Apple does something new, I'll stick with products for the consumer.",YouTube
8602,how much did apple pay you lol to fool people to buy it? the iphone 8 and later version is not worth to buy but i have a feeling they will change their path to smartwatch and focus on that watch,YouTube

8607,"Summing up iOS as a 'grid-array' of icons is largely unfair. There is so much advanced software and features in iOS that play a huge role in making iOS as successful as it is, the current camera app being a small example. The home UI might not have widgets, but this is not something hard to implement from a technical point of view. The things Apple is doing with machine learning, AI, and optimization are so much more impressive than some toy widget on a home screen. Apple doesn't have widgets on the home screen because they feel it harms the user experience, period.",YouTube

Is it really that hard for you to plug a cable in? 2:30 - ""battery life is WAY better"" and then your left shoulder jumps up, showing you don't believe what you're saying. #microexpressions 6:40 - why oh why didn't Apple just make it 128GB and 256GB? It's not like it actually makes a difference in size within the phone now and flash ram is cheap is chips now. 7:25 - Just an FYI - when someone's voice raises several octaves it generally means they don't believe what they are saying. Or it's not 100% truthful comment. 8:08 - it's about damn time it had water resistance. Still falling behind android devices though unfortunately.",YouTube
8610,"Indeed, android phone's always better and advance technology comparing to iPhone, yet I still stick with Apple iPhone because I don't feel my phone too old when the latest iPhone come out. I can use my iPhone 2 or 3 year with new iOS update like the newest one. Unlike android phone, from one generation to one is a huge upgrade, slow android OS update and make us want to upgrade. Save Money",YouTube
8611,"I'm a long time Android user and just purchased an 8 Plus rather than Pixel 2 XL. I do alot of video editing both in phone and on my Mac, so having the seamlessness of iMovie and Airdrop were a big deal. Most important was screen brightness when I'm shooting video at outdoor events. I don't know why, but my eyes see LCD brightness much easier than amoled. But yeah, I see the trade off when it comes to less rich blacks on-screen. I will miss Google assistant because Siri is a whore to use. Don't give a damn about bezels... And actually prefer the touch ID button on the front of the phone. Also, this glass backed iPhone feels so premium, and was $100 less than a similar 64gig Pixel 2 XL.  Just my choice.. Good luck with yours.",YouTube
8612,"Lol, 24 months. Be a man and keep a phone for at least 3 years. I had my iPhone 4 for 4 years, followed by an iPhone 6 Plus that I had for three years, which I replaced with a Xperia ZX Premium, which was promptly returned and switched for an iPhone 8., which I am very happy with.",YouTube

8615,In my opinion it’s time for me an apple sheep to change to android,YouTube
8616,Iphones sreens are shamefull,YouTube
8617,I have s8+ Want an 8 plus,YouTube
8618,I came to Apple with the iPhone 6+ and will never go back to Addroid. Waiting for the X :),YouTube
8619,When you get a Galaxy Note 8 ad before this video... #Irony,YouTube
8620,Is just me? Or seems like apple paid the YouTuber bloggers to make us buy their not exciting anymore iPhones 8 and 8 plus.,YouTube
8621,Got the 8 over the X only because of the lack of fingerprint scanner. People don't realize just how inconvenient it will be to have to put in your passcode every time you don't want to pick up your phone and look like you're taking a selfie. Plus having to swipe from the top for control center and no home button. I can see myself trying to swipe up but having the phone swipe sideways and vice-versa when I'm using it one-handed. Hopefully the next X-series phone has a fingerprint scanner on the back at least and I'll consider it.,YouTube
8622,look I love having an iphone because the build quality is always super super nice it feels great. I love imessage and facetime. I can easily message or call 90% of my friends with imessage or facetime with wifi even if im traveling and its the native messaging app i dont have to download a thing like whatsapp etc. its clean and smooth and has a great camera and never fails me. i really dont give a rats ass andriods can do this or that better than my iphone in the end my user experience is what matters and i love it on my iphone.,YouTube
8623,"1. This phone looks different BUT design is same as its 4 year old iteration?  2. This phone is great BECAUSE finally wireless charging? 3. This phone is great BECAUSE the color is different?

8630,How much did apple pay this guy?,YouTube
8631,"iPhone 8 Plus all day! The iPhone X looks cool, but I don't need to be spending $999 on a phone and the idea of losing the fingerprint scanner and reachability just does not work for me. I am living on an iPhone 6 and the jump from the 6 to 8 Plus is going to be plenty for me.",YouTube
8632,Samsung makes phones for poor uneducated morons lol. just a fact. i've triggered some idiots lololololol,YouTube
8633,"Ok, so not being biased and ""reviewing the product objectively"", here are the new and exciting features the iPhone 8 brings:  - Different exterior colors - Glass-back - Wireless-charging (still slower than Androids) - Better battery life (with some devices having expanding batteries that actually rip the phone open) - Best processor ever, granting 1 second faster game lauchings - Super AMOLED screen (last gen though) - Camera on par with competition - Good speakers... (no headphone jack) - ""Close to parity with features and specs of Android phones""  Yeah, I changed my mind as well...",YouTube
8634,Waiting on the iPhone X. Finally a iPhone screen that’s on par with Samsung,YouTube
8635,"Android fuckboys are so narrow minded that they cant even fathom how an iPhone can be a good phone with good attributes. These comments are ridiculously sad for you guys, smh.",YouTube
8636,"The iphone x is just way too different for me right now. So I dropped my 7 plus and went for the 8 plus for the new design, better camera, wireless charging etc. We will have to see what apple does in the future to determine if im staying of not.",YouTube
8637,Battery life talk is BS.,YouTube
8638,sounds like a paid review lol,YouTube
8639,"So, apple finally nailed everything Google, Samsung and LG had nailed 2 years back and it still doesn't have a 2k panel! And Apple's excuse for 2k AMOLED panel coming so late to the iPhone(X) is that there was no 2k panel good enough! Samsung and Google have been having 2k panels since 2 years and tto this date, Samsung, LG, Google and Sony have still got better panels, much more vibrant and brighter  And you priced it over 1000$!",YouTube
8640,Have an iPhone 6s switching to the Pixel XL2 because I simply want something different. I don’t hate Apple but I’ve had too many iPhones and it’s just boring now,YouTube
8641,iPhone 8 has horrible battery life. Over 50% less than S8+. Pure garbage.  iPhone 8 Plus is an amazing device though. They hit a home run with everything but bezels. 50% shinkage at top and bottom would make a lot of ppl wanna buy it. Those chins look really outdated. Id buy it if it wasnt for the chins.,YouTube
8642,"Every single time someone complains about the resolution on any iPhone newer than the 3GS, I get pissed off. At 326 PPI, you cannot see the pixels unless you have superhuman eyes. At over 400 PPI, still that remains true. If you don't like the display, it's certainly not the resolution that's throwing you off.",YouTube
8643,Why wireless charging work slow is for that iPhone only can charge 7.5 watt while many Android phones can charge 15 watt. Testing it out here and did find things like that if you are interested.,YouTube
8644,Switched from 6s Plus to Note 8 to 8 Plus. I’m finally home. The speed is unmatched.,YouTube
8645,*You've thoroughly convinced me that blacks shouldn't have the right to vote OR review smartphones. They simply don't have the capacity to make impartial decisions.*,YouTube
8646,"?Well, thank you. You give me hope with this video because I just can’t do / don’t want to do an Android device at all. Truthfully, I like/love the “old standard style” iPhone with home button (I wouldn’t mind if the top & bottom borders were less wide but it’s fine) and I really don’t care about a full OLED screen at all. The cost, software functionality & productivity options matter more to me. Oh and I’d really really like to have that headphone jack! ? But honestly I’ve ruined & had to replace so many headphones because they got caught on things while plugged in that it’s probably better that I use wireless bluetooth headsets/earpieces any way. ??",YouTube
8647,I love my galaxy s8 plus and my iphone 8 plus.(256gb),YouTube
8648,This video helped me out I’m getting iPhone 8 Monday next week. Do you have a video on the AR feature?,YouTube
8649,I definitely wanted to have 8plus but because of its screen and same design i choose s8 instead. Got s8 in a good deal....not to forget the pricing where i live is wayyyy too much for i8plus,YouTube
8650,"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge user here. I'm getting really close to paying off this phone and thinking about switching to a new phone. I narrowed down to 3 choices.   They are: Google Pixel XL, Samsung Note 8, and the iPhone 8+.   In your experience, what do these phones have in common and what differences do they have? I used to own an iPhone 6 in the past, so switching to Apple wouldn't be a problem, but can't so much about the Pixel.",YouTube
8651,but the 8 is 720p right? as the 8+ is 1080p? and why would i bother filming in 4k when the screen res isnt even 4k,YouTube

8658,Wrong again? What do they give you for changing your mind.,YouTube
8659,"A while ago I was at the mall and I have 3 choices, the iPhone 8+, the Samsung Note 8 and the Pixel 2 XL, and I said I'mma go to the 8+ because it is just right for my budget, I love the Phone, got it in Black, 256 GB and got a folding case, I might say the phone feels a bit dull, But I bought it because I am more of a BEZEL GUY than a BEZELESS GUY and the phone was a cheetah when running. So the 8+ is the best choice.",YouTube

8680,"After weeks of using my iPhone X, I recommend the X by a wide margin. The FaceID works every time, and is nearly instantaneous. Being able to use FaceID with Apple Pay is another major advantage. I can do everything with the iPhone X in one hand, from selecting apps, scrolling between apps, and using all areas of the screen with my thumb. The screen is absolutely superb, bright and clear, even in very bright ambient light. I am a heavy advocate of Siri, and the accuracy, speed and ease on the X is far better than my previous iPhone 7 Plus. I can get two days of use with one charge, and I enjoy the Animoji and Portrait Lighting features on the X. As for price, I have a 256GB version, with a superb Apple leather folio case. All up, just under $1,300. I use the upgrade program, making the cost $55 per month. Excellent value. My best friend switched to Samsung, to cut costs, and changed back to iPhone after two weeks. The Samsung looks and functions like a generic Pc, versus an Apple MacBook Pro. Given the massive amount I use my iPhone, and the general amazing usability across iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, the costs are a tiny investment compared to the benefits. There’s way too little discussion of the financial and operational benefits of going all-in with Apple. My experience has taken my communications and workload much better, compared to the feedback I get from PC, Surface and assorted Smartphone users. Anyone who can’t see the value-added from platform quality, usability, residual values, software and support has hang-ups with Apple that probably require the services of a skilled psychotherapist!",YouTube

8737,Guys pick iPhone 8 not iPhone X,YouTube
8738,I got iPhone 8 plus 256 GB recently and I must say I m quite satisfied.I previously owned iPhone 6s plus for 2yrs and wanted to buy iPhone X but changed my mind at the last moment.I want to wait for a year or two to see where apple goes from here.Pros for 8plus: 1)Speakers and overall sound quality is SUPER amazing. 2)True tone along with retina HD screen is quite good as it helps to make the screen and apps look more vibrant. 3)With the glass back the phone is more sturdy to hold in hand and looks vintage. 4)It supports wireless fast charging just like iPhone X. 5)Battery is also better than 6S plus.(half an hour extra life) moderate usage 6)I felt that the bezel of 8 plus is couple of mm's shorter than on 6s plus when I placed the phones side by side.I may be wrong.It is not visible readily. Cons 1)Camera is good but not up to the level of many other phones in the market.I felt iPhone X is better than 8plus in this aspect. 2)True tone doesn't do justice at low level light. 3)It's quite heavy to carry(202 gms),YouTube
8739,I’m waiting til next year to get the X,YouTube
8740,"I am still on my iPhone 6S and I saw no reason to upgrade to 7 and I see no reason to upgrade to 8 or X.

8760,"IPhone 8 is best of the 3, it’s the cheapest and has the best value. You’re sacrificing screen size for pocket ability which is a fair trade, the iPhone 8 is also as powerful as both the 8+ and 10. The only big difference between the 3 is the screen and camera. The 8+ is a nice middle ground as it has cameras not as bad as the 8 or as good as the 10. In my opinion the 8+’s screen is best of the 3 as it is a good size and has a nice aspect ratio. (Even though it’s not a bright OLED) The only people who really would get a 10 are people who don’t understand the technical specifications of the 3 and only care about their status on social media and all that shit, they just see it as $400 for some shitty animojis.",YouTube

I'm probably never upgrading from my 6S because I need a headphone jack, but most of the 'cool' stuff about this 8 is stuff that's trying to be 'too clever' and will end up failing. I can already feel my anger as I imagine picking it up from its wireless charging pad ready to go out for the day, only to realise it wasn't quiiiite situated right so didn't charge overnight. Or, setting off on a long plane flight only to realise my wireless headphones have run out of batteries, another thing that would be simply a non-issue with regular wired headphones.

8793,"The negativity in the comments section by android users is absurd. Yes they are late to most technologies, yes they are wayyyy too expensive. But sometimes, Apples attention to detail and quality is what wins people. Those who don't ever use apple technology wont feel the smootheness and the fluidity using an iPhone provides, they are already used to the slightly slower processing power of androids. Cosmetics wise, who cares? I like Apples simplicity, although sometimes it isn't as easy to navigate, but for me, it beats the ""shove everything on one page"" look that values only utility and neglects all visuals whatsoever. If you have gotten to this part in this comment without replying angrily or disliking, then you should agree that android and iOS are completely different platforms of the same technology. One should compare them, and value certain aspects over the other.  But when it comes to other's preferences, who gives a damn.",YouTube

Brand A/B/C mungkin punya keunggulan dari beberapa aspek dibandingin iPhone 8 tp toh gda smartphone yg perfect kan? Namanya aja buatan manusia. Mau harga belasan juta pun tetep aja punya kekurangan, toh ujung""nya cuma dipake buat ngegaya/chatt sosial media/foto"" yg ujung""nya diupload ke sosmed/denger musik/nonton video/ngegame bla bla ... dan ga smua jg fitur canggih yg ada di smartphone tsb dipake. Jd kl baca bbrp comment ada yg nyinyir sm Apple, ada jg yg nyinyir sm Samsung, gue baca nya agak lucu aja. User experience tiap orang itu beda"", ga ada yg sama krn kebutuhan seseorang akan sebuah smartphone pun ga sama. Jd ga bs jg sih secara subjektif kita menilai Samsung lebih unggul dr Apple atau sebaliknya, krn tiap brand dgn productnya punya keunggulan dan kelemahan masing"".  Ujung""nya balik lg ke isi dompet kan? Kl ada org yg sanggup beli smartphone seharga belasan juta ya udah sih toh duit"" dia jg, even akhirnya mungkin agak nyesel belakangan krn satu atau dua hal, itu bukan urusan kita jg kali.  Btw, soal camera di iPhone 8 kesannya emang biasa aja tp kl nyobain iPhone 8 Plus dgn fitur"" yg ada bakalan beda experience nya hehe. Kualitas layar jg ya beda antara iPhone 8 dgn 8 Plus, emang lebih puas pake 8 Plus.

I bought the LGv30 to try and see if I could android again and nope I returned it after a day of use and got the iPhone 8 plus. The software was slow the camera was extremely laggy. I find this on most android devices though, unfortunately. I’m not a apple fanboy at all, I love my custom built pc and would choose it over any Mac any day. At the end of the day it comes down to personal preference. Try every phone out for yourself at the store before buying, don’t order online it may be easier but it may also may screw you over because you’ll end up hating the phone you got.",YouTube

9303,"I’ve been using a 5SE recently. Much easier to use than a larger phone. Hate it when people refer to the iPhone ten as the X . Roman numeral for 10. If you don’t do a lot of photography or videos, getting the 8 Plus is a complete waste of money. If you just want a phone, the iPhone 8 is more than adequate.",YouTube

9329,iOS 11 is the shittiest version of iOS ever released. Assholes are concentrating more on emojis than battery and functionality.,YouTube
9330,It's my plan A because I am not spending 1500 bucks on a phone,YouTube
9331,Finally an iPhone 8 review about the 8 and not the plus version. So many iPhone videos they title it 8 but mostly talk about the plus. Thank you Jaime some people prefer the 4.7 iPhone more.,YouTube
9332,When I click on a pocketnow video I always get an ad by Mr. Mobile which makes me go there instead of watching this.,YouTube
9333,When coming from an iPhone 6 to an 8 it’s a great upgrade,YouTube

9335,"apparently pocketnow wants to milk max amount of videos out of iphone; sound review, impressions, hands on, comparison, review, detailed review: what's next review of review?",YouTube
9336,These iPhones are really making the pixel phones really eye catching...and interesting.,YouTube
9337,I'm so tired of hearing about dbrand,YouTube
9338,"Jaime just grew a foot taller with the amount of stretching he had to do to find positives about the iPhone.  He actually said: ""you don't need fast charging for a battery this small"" #wtf",YouTube
9339,"i am actually a fan of the iPhone + series, i would have rather they put an oled screen on the iPhone 8+",YouTube
9340,"iphone 8 is like the iphone 6 and 7, ppl are waiting for the X to come out and see how much carriers are going to charge. It is about $45/month after tax totaled from $1100",YouTube
9341,"Dear apple     *Screw your iPhone 8*    Sincerely,  Apple fan",YouTube
9342,"I dont get how people find iPhones boring. It has better software than any andriod phone, and has some fun perks. Ive never owned an iPhone, but most of my friends do and it seems much more fun than my s7 edge.",YouTube

9345,Pixel 2 or nothing.,YouTube
9346,"iPhone 8 a ""great Plan B""? It's just an iPhone 7 with a shatterable back and wireless charging that is so slow that it's not worth bothering with. Note sure what the charge time is on the iP8, but the iP8+ has a wireless charge time of 4 hours. (Yes, really.) The iP8 is basically the iP7, which is basically the iP6s, which is basically the iP6. The most reasonable Plan B for an iPhone person would be to simply skip upgrading in 2017, unless you have an iPhone 5 or previous. Or is the instinct to pay more money to Apple every year too strong for iSheep to resist?",YouTube
9347,I got it an it's the same..... Blah,YouTube
9348,Those who plan to buy the CRAPPLE X don't know how to spend their money productively,YouTube
9349,Isheep,YouTube
9350,"and Im here, still with my Iphone 6, waiting for the 7 to be less expensive",YouTube
9351,720p same design from the 6  no headphone jack over $700,YouTube

9353,Stop saying the iPhone X is all screen! With that hideous notch on top it disqualifies from that category.,YouTube
9354,Don't need fast charging for a small battery? Really?,YouTube
9355,"The iPhone design is outdated and the iPhone “X” has that ugly lip thing to it. I’m feeling the G30 and the Galaxy Note 8. The pixel is nice, but I think LG V30 has the design that the pixel should have had. I’ll just wait for the 2018 pixel or iPhone. I’m rocking a 6s Plus.",YouTube
9356,Still no reason to change my 6s for 8 or even X...,YouTube
9357,"""iOS 11 is the most robust version of iOS ever""... Umm, slower performance, worse battery life, etc. Nope.",YouTube
9358,This video was sponsored by apple to sell the iPhone8,YouTube
9359,"It's not that people are waiting for the iPhone X, it's that nobody wants to buy an iPhone anymore..",YouTube
9360,It really is mind-boggling that they can release essentially the same phone year after year. What would happen to a car company if they released the same car year after year with only a few minor changes. And they all looked identical. They would be out of business. This really means that people do not give a crap about what they're buying in the smartphone space,YouTube
9361,This one is for the sheep who buy what there friends have bought just to scheme cool. Yet dishing out so much mooney for so little in return.,YouTube
9362,"iPhone users don’t care about design anymore. iPhone and Apple have become even more of a status symbol vs a gadget. It’s very capable, but most people do not utilize all the features that these phones come with. You can tell how abysmal this phone has been with the stock price. Keeps on dropping. The only reason I use one is that my family is all on iMessage and so are 99% of my clients.",YouTube
9363,No need to upgrade to the new iphone 8 when the 6 of three years ago is still being supported... No need to waste money for the sake upgrading...  ?,YouTube
9364,two days before iphone X came out i bought an iphone 8:),YouTube
9365,Battery that small and 720p in 2017?,YouTube
9366,DBrand skins .. no thanks.  We got to see a appearance of Jaime Rivera Jr lol,YouTube
9367,still no headphone jack,YouTube
9368,Would go for the 8 Plus due to that 1080p display,YouTube
9369,Yes Jaime ? 50 cent many men was? on the control centre,YouTube
9370,"Prefer metal back phone. No reason to upgrade from iphone 7+.  ios 11 still buggy though, battery life is above average. Only 2gb RAM? Yes, the software is so efficient",YouTube
9371,I told you!!!!!! No iPhone X for a year!!!!! ?,YouTube
9372,"It amazes me that people are mad at Apple because they have a top line phone and lesser models. This nothing new they've been on the plan for years now. Regular models and Plus models is in Apple's ecosystem. I guess since the X isn't available at launch like the others have people all butt hurt that they cant get the best from Apple. Its gotten so bad that reviewers are trying to tear down the 8 and 8 Plus, when same people praised the 7 and 7 plus all the while the newer phones are upgrades even though small. It seems Apple has to move mountains and reinvent the wheel with every iteration of the IPhone to make people happy while every other manufacturer does the same with new improvements over an older phone. This guy says Apple is ""terrible"" at first generation products which is a bunch of crap. If you have watched any of his videos before he doesn't like Apple's IPhone. So with saying that he is assuring that the IPhone X will be bad because its a first gen product. Cmon Jaime",YouTube
9373,Love the 8 Super fast,YouTube
9374,iOS 11 draines battery like crazy and according to Pocket Now battery time is better then ever. Something isn't right here?,YouTube
9375,I hate the fact that people are calling the 10 innovation,YouTube
9376,"looks like I stumbled upon an ad...not much of a review  (1) 720p screen in Laaaaate 2017 (2) No fast charger included for $700 ? (3) Same crappy design for the 4th year ! 300$ android phones have been better in these areas since 2015   Only pros are ios, A11 chip and Apple's focus on quality over specs  One thing Apple has surely mastered is milking its products for all their worth",YouTube
9377,Great review! I agree with all points. Personally I’m going for the iPhone X because of the radical change. But the iPhone 8 seems a little to similar to the iPhone 7. I’ve owned every iPhone since the original and the iPhone X seems like every iPhone fans must hav upgrade. My predication is that it will be the best selling iPhone of all time.,YouTube
9378,Been with  apple for 9 years.. I have ipad pro for media content.. I am with Jobs use phone to text check scores and yes make phone calls iPhone 8 is fast effective truly one hand,YouTube

9382,Display is 750p in 2017,YouTube
9383,"I just bought my iPhone 7 three months ago, literally three months ago, and the only thing that helps me not to regret about it, is the fact that they only changed the aluminum body to a glass body ???",YouTube
9384,"The phone is not worth it, even as a plan B.",YouTube
9385,"The reign of Apple(mobile) is now coming to an end with or without the A11 Bionic soc,the first signs are already here - Google Pixel 2 and the whole new future ahead with AI (Deepmind)..I'm an Apple fan since iPhone 3G..but it's time to change!..the time Google rethink the Play Store it's all over !",YouTube
9386,"That title was a little misleading; where was the ""Plan B"", and will you be discussing the reports of Iphone 8 Plus batteries causing phones to split open due to rapid explansion?",YouTube
9387,Can't say great battery life when the ppi on the phone is 326 that means 720p,YouTube
9388,Upgraded from 6. Too long to wait for X. I won’t need X features. Love 8,YouTube
9389,This is the first review that I feel is baised. He likes iPhone and he's just saying that but what about all the other people?,YouTube
9390,Love the 8 plus...,YouTube
9391,maybe battery life is enough for u but i am damn sure that phone wont last till bed for me. iphone is best when phone is asleep but for moderate use that battery capacity aint enough for young generation users ???,YouTube
9392,Goodbye Apple? I’m switching to galaxy s8?,YouTube
9393,iPhone 8 is the best,YouTube
9394,finally apple is dying,YouTube

9397,Not mentioning 720P in entire review... how much did you get payed by Apple?,YouTube
9398,"Well DUH! How was this not foreseen when pretty much all of us commenting here knew it would be a bust and that everyone would wait for the X? As for myself, I will never again by an iPhone because I like my headphone jack. Which is why I still have my 6S+.",YouTube
9399,The Pixel is better than the iPhone.,YouTube
9400,Boycott this ridiculous iPhone,YouTube

9414,iPhone X will be phone of the year,YouTube
9415,"It’s for people who want iPhone upgrade but can’t afford the 1000$ price tag, simply put",YouTube
9416,"Now that you have watched the Pocketnow video, I will tell you truth.   1. Many iPhone owners are waking-up to the fact that the iPhone8 isn't all that much of an upgrade from the 7 or even 6, so they're not going to waste their money on buying a phone that isn't much different from what they already have.   2. There are many people who are taking a liking to Android phones. I know quite a few former iPhone owners who got fed up with the lack of battery-life in iPhones-among other things-and switched over to an Andriod device-particularly a Samsung Galaxy or LG phone. And I don't see too many holding out for the iPhone 10 either. Not worth the price.  3. Who is the iPhone 8 for?  It's for the guilible Apple fan who is suckered into the hype of having some new...non-new tech device from Apple.",YouTube
9417,iPhones became boring and obsolete. 6s was last decent one and then it went to shit,YouTube
9418,I’m good with my iPhone SE for now. I’m not too big on this smaller bezel craze. I may upgrade to a Pixel 2 next year. It actually looks pretty good.,YouTube
9419,"DBRAND NOT SERIOUS at all, I suggest not buying from them. I placed the order, after a week they send the package, and not even now 2 week later the skin didn't arrive.

9437,Thank you for not listing the specs and boring stuff that every reviewer talks 90% of their videos about. The experience is what we wanna know about. Chances are if you're looking to buy the phone you'll look at a multitude of videos so will hear the other bs elsewhere.,YouTube
9438,6:23 Oh and I was wondering since the begining why was the sound so weird...,YouTube

9448,Android > iOS,YouTube
9449,LORD PLEASE STOP WITH APPLE ALREADY. They disappointed me this year. I'm switching to Note 8 or LG v30.,YouTube
9450,Hey mister what are you zooming in? 2:14 ?,YouTube
9451,Not even MKBHD reviews as good as MrMobile does!,YouTube
9452,The iPhone is the best smartphone on the market.....for me,YouTube
9453,Is there some problem with the audio of this review? I  was checking my phone's HEADPHONE  jack for any malfunction ?,YouTube
9454,The gold color this year looks fantastic. I wish they had included it on the X. From the shots I’ve seen from the 8/plus cameras they seemed to have found a really nice balance between slightly bumping up the saturation while still keeping the shots natural looking.,YouTube
9455,"I can tell Michael Fisher is really impressed with the iPhone, and being the type of high calibre reviewer he is, I am sure he is able to see beyond everybody's initial holler of ""same old design"", ""same old LCD display"" and actually see how good this phone is.",YouTube
9456,Big fan of yours,YouTube
9457,Same awful design for 3+ years.  Shame. Shame. Shame.,YouTube
9458,I mean ....if this guy will review anything ...I will watch it !,YouTube
9459,I found the video a little sad and here's why. Samsung S8 plus and Note 8 where sarcastically compared. But Apple's 8 & 8+ didn't receive the same treatment and they not only look like last year's model but the year before (6 & 6+) as well. I love all phones and have no allegiance to either. Just thought I'd comment on an observation.,YouTube
9460,Under 1000 views club!,YouTube
9461,Holyyy shitt it's so powerful. I'm an Android fan or more specifically a Samsung fan but this review made  me rethink stuff,YouTube
9462,I've expended 5 minutes looking at the iPhone 8 at the Apple Store and here is my 25 minutes in depth review part 1,YouTube
9463,But the main question remains unanswered. Can it download songs from browser? ?????,YouTube
9464,"Anyone else tired of hearing ""OLED colors pop""?  I guess natural realistic colors are boring",YouTube
9465,"Boring and even kinda ugly design, especially from the company that designed the iPhone 4 / 4s and iPhone 5 / 5s / SE which I think are two of the most beautiful smartphone designs of all time but seems like a very good smartphone overall.",YouTube
9466,"the iPhone 8 is outclassed in design heavily this year with last few years bezel and lcd and not even HDR, should have at least HDR it and 120hz it like the iPads, as Rene would say, HDR is more noticeable than 1440p on such a small screen. I think 4.6inch is fine, all I ask for my old phone is it goes faster, but I also understand that most folks like big screens, smaller bezels.   The A11 is a different beast, I refuse to see it going past an intel i5, man the XPS 13 now looks really slow. It will make the phone more reasonable to be updated for a few more years. Apple definitely needs the neural engine on the chip, since they do machine learning on device. Anyway wondering why nobody benchmark the new apple designed graphics chip, wonder how good is it, can it match the latest adreno or Mali.",YouTube
9467,1:24 Nexus 4 . Surprised me there . I can't believe  how it has been forgotten . It was an impressive device for its time,YouTube
9468,Battery azzizz..,YouTube
9469,"Gotta say, the iPhone 8 seems to be a really good phone (and I'm one of those who hated Apple for it's lack of effort). It is a solid product for it's price now, at least in my opinion. But for Android geeks it's just boring compared to the X, that phone is mind blowing in comparison.",YouTube
9470,Which app you have used for ar in this video where we can we the constellation... Plz share with me.. ?,YouTube
9471,Says there's no phone that does this. Forgot he reviewed the xz premium. :(,YouTube
9472,Hws the battery life of iPhone 8/8+... Apart from the camera whts special with 8+..,YouTube
9473,Did u notice that micheal touch id didn't unlock  what may be the reason,YouTube
9474,Why does your voice sound weird in this review? O.o,YouTube
9475,When it comes to the wireless charging I'd say that it's better to have an aluminium body over glass any day even at the cost of wireless charging.,YouTube
9476,"All I can say about the new iPhone is ""boring"", same thing I said with the 7, same thing I said with the 6S. Maybe it's not really boring but I just don't care about Apple anymore.",YouTube
9477,V30 review?,YouTube
9478,Ah I watched untill end and then realised why audio is messed up,YouTube
9479,Can someone tell me what wireless charger is shown at 2:02,YouTube
9480,Wireless charging is SOOOOO overrated.  You can't even really use your phone while it's wirelessly charging,YouTube
9481,4K 60fps is definitely commendable... Coming from an Android user who has never bought iPhones,YouTube
9482,"Apple is clearly trying to copy Microsoft, they skipped 9 maybe there is an illuminati for that",YouTube
9483,Iphone 8,YouTube
9484,"I don't know who's true and who's lying, but I have seen the reviews where Note-8 floored iPhone 8 in-camera feature. It has bigger aperture, so better low light. Smooth images even inside a racing car, Note-8 also takes better portrait photos. It's hard to trust reviewers nowadays. The only thing where iPhone 8 excelled was the speed of processor.",YouTube
9485,More like iPhone 7S and 7S+,YouTube
9486,I prefer the iPhone 8+ over the X honestly,YouTube
9487,Michael Fisher I am eagerly waiting for your review on iPhone X or 10. Would be nice to see it go under the Mr. Mobile's test.,YouTube
9488,"I might not be interested in the iPhone 8, I'm always exited for the new mr  mobile video!",YouTube
9489,"Still looks so ugly, big bazels and slow charging",YouTube

9491,"What a video , pro until the fist second until the last .  Wish I could get the iPhone 8+ , I am so bored of Android and my Samsung S8+ . BTW Michael , I never , ever used wirless charging and I will never use it because I only have 1 phone and I use it a lot , even when charging .",YouTube
9492,Mr. Mobile is the best reviewer ever,YouTube
9493,I’m here and I ain’t getting new iPhone. Anyone else?,YouTube
9494,"Still on iPhone 6, will probably get this one, $1,000 is too much to spend on a phone...",YouTube
9495,Watching it on my iPhone 8...,YouTube
9496,"i dont get how its wireless charging when you still need a charging pad with CABLES to charge your phone?  lol Also, i still dont see the point of wireless charging.... you cant charge it when you pick it up and its slower than plugging your phone in directly.  Love your videos BTW. great job!",YouTube
9497,"Do you know what this is? Aeh, the iPhone 7? No, it's the IPhone 8. Oh sorry, couldn't fucking see it from the front :D",YouTube
9498,This phone is awesome,YouTube
9499,"I wasn't so enthusiastic about the new iPhones after they were presented, but what I see as reviews of the 8/8 Plus, they look so much more future-proof than ANY android on the market right now in terms of performance, software, camera etc. That just makes me think that if face ID on the iPhone X turns out to be working as reliably as touch ID, it may actually be worth the price tag, cuz you are getting the already future-proof iPhone 8 features, adding MORE futuristic features like design, display, face ID, portrait mode front facing camera. The price is still ridiculous, but imagine if you pay 1200$ for an iPhone X, 256 GB, and keep the phone for like 3 years, maybe more or less. It may be worth it. It depends on how reliable the new features are. Currently? a phone like the V30 looks like a better bang for the buck, but still Apple's software support is so much better, that's a big selling point if you ask me.",YouTube
9500,Does anyone else actually like his voice?,YouTube
9501,Awesome review Mr Michael Fisher,YouTube
9502,"I still hate the display, they shouldn't release a white iphone if they can't get their whites to look white instead of yellow (1:11) because it stands out. Also, 750p looks terrible for a 2017 flagship, deal-breaker for display junkies like me.",YouTube
9503,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4psKYpfnYs,YouTube
9504,i still don't like iOS,YouTube
9505,Iphone 8 ..... the only phone you have to pay further 90$ to get fast charging ... sonething you can get from s6 to note 8 for free,YouTube
9506,"Hey nice review Michael Fisher! i love your honest reviews. but i had a doubt regarding that glass back of the iPhone. Is it gorilla glass, and is it as big of a fingerprint magnet as the jet black color of the iPhone 7?",YouTube
9507,and 720p,YouTube
9508,planning to buy iphone 5s.. it it okay?,YouTube
9509,"Hi Michael , superb  ?",YouTube
9510,It’s a snow cone maker,YouTube
9511,"I fully confess that the one thing I hate about your videos is how you pronounce 'mobile'.  As a chap from the UK I'm just used to saying it, as it should be damn it, as 'mo-bile', so hearing it said as 'mo-bill' sounds really odd and annoying the more it is said.  Speaks for your content I suppose that I can put up with it.",YouTube
9512,I love Apple and I well buy it when I have the money but way the heck dose it cost 25$ for a fast charger usb ?  Am kinda glad they don’t give you it’s bad for your Battery but it’s convenient,YouTube
9513,Well said about Who’s looking for this phone,YouTube
9514,"6:23 - 6:30 That explains why the video sounded different from usual. Not bad by any means, but that part confirmed my suspicion. ???",YouTube
9515,Yeah like me upgrade from 6s+..,YouTube
9516,I'm thinking of buying this phone instead of the x. $1000 just seems out of hand paying for a phone. I know the 8 is an old designed phone but it's a classic design.,YouTube
9517,2:12 to the right zoom in on that titty,YouTube
9518,Any other phone? You mean Sony?,YouTube
9519,You underestimated the glass to be honest,YouTube
9520,I think the only thing that's profound about the iPhone is the camera and more specifically the video camera. It pretty much has the smoothest video out of the big boys.   Everything else I'll give to android,YouTube
9521,Hi do the screen has 120hz or still same with iphone 7?,YouTube
9522,your tech 21 is con and dumb they sent me a defective screen protector and they refused to respond to my inquiry.,YouTube
9523,Gotta love people who make objective reviews! Pure quality. Thank you. :-),YouTube
9524,mr mobile please review nokia 8,YouTube
9525,"I think the reason people like iphone is, and this is from an android fan because   1. the software is not as glitchy, cleaner  and much more optimized-speed 2.The Apple ecosystem works very well(air pods, iPad, mac books etc) 3. Its much more simple and predictable  Now I know the new iPhones are not that innovative and way too expensive but for someone who always uses apple, I can understand why they like the iPhone.",YouTube
9526,@3:03 I don't agree with your video review. I have personally tested and have found shooting a video on samsung note 8 plus 8 is way more like professional film making,YouTube
9527,pretty much nailed it.,YouTube
9528,say hello to your new subscriber *subbed* this is lit,YouTube
9529,This is an incredible review man!,YouTube
9530,you deserve more subs,YouTube
9531,Night shift is not about color accuracy. It is used to provide less eye hassle while at night at the sacrifice of realistic colors.,YouTube
9532,"Absolutely terrific video, Tyler. It was so refreshing to see a cool new perspective on a phone review -- the perspective of a photographer. Keep up the great work.",YouTube
9533,lol this guy is a photographer and reviews better than the tech youtubers,YouTube
9534,"this is by far the best iphone 8 review i've come across, and i think i've seen almost every single one ? you deserve waaay more subscribers. keep it up! i'm excited to see your upcoming videos",YouTube
9535,"Can't wait to see your iPhone X review. This iPhone 8 review is easily one of my favorites, much like your review on the AirPods was my favorite review for them. Keep up the good work! ?",YouTube
9536,I went to the 8 Plus for the 6S Plus. Absolutely loving it!,YouTube
9537,"I have it for 2 weeks, it’s amazing device!! Camera gives clean results even in low light situations",YouTube
9538,My god is it beautiful in Calgary...,YouTube
9539,My dad ordered mine for good grades,YouTube
9540,"I went from a beat up hand me down 6 to an 8+, and all I have to say is... Holy crap",YouTube
9541,"5:20    Iphone 8 charges with 5 watts wirelessly and the s8 charges 15 watts wirelessly... Apple is just behind, not the whole industry...",YouTube
9542,Tyler your videos are on fire ? Great editing as always ??,YouTube
9543,"Tyler, quick tip. There is another reason Apple has removed the HDR original and just uses the HDR version by default. With the new HEIF photo format, the original is now actually stored within the HDR photo itself. If you don't like how the HDR version looks, just edit the photo to remove the HDR effect. This is now true of portraits as well, which similarly removed the original version.   This saves a lot of space and is much less confusing for newbie shooters who never clearly understood why they had multiple versions of the same photos.",YouTube
9544,Incredible video Tyler. Great cinematography and extremely informative.  I like how you're comparing it to the 6s instead of to the 7 as most reviewers do - most people will be upgrading from a 6s and if you have a 7 upgrading to the 8 is pretty much useless anyway.,YouTube
9545,This is rad. Will you put the Pixel 2 through the same paces?,YouTube
9546,"This was an absolutely fantastic review mate. Very honest, real, and informative.",YouTube
9547,Can't get over the amazing quality of your videos,YouTube
9548,I have the 8 plus in gold and I upgraded from a 6s (not plus). In my opinion it was definitely worth it. The battery is a lot better and the pictures come out so much better. It’s almost like a professional camera! Definitely recommend updating if you have a 6s or older but in my opinion it’s not worth it if you have a 7 plus already,YouTube
9549,I phone is best,YouTube
9550,Best iPhone 8 review I've seen yet ??,YouTube
9551,This is the best iPhone 8 review.. always wanted to see smartphone reviews from a photographer perspective. Please do more smartphone reviews,YouTube
9552,"Hi, Tyler! Nice review, man. Hopefully you'll get your views and subscribers up very soon. 1 question - have you tested shooting RAW on iPhones? Does it make sense to do it? Is there any additional details you can pull from RAW in Lightroom? Alex",YouTube
9553,"Such a good review. I agree 99%. Personally don’t mind the lack of a headphone jack (I am an iPhone 7 Plus owner), but I also don’t understand why Lightning still exists.   Actually, USB-C would have made me upgrade. I guess I will try to get at least one more year out of my 7 Plus.",YouTube
9554,Pixel feels/runs smoother and the camera is certainly better at dynamic range. I have an iPhone myself but I don't get the hpye any longer. They've been  plateauing for years hardware wise.,YouTube
9555,Hit Like Before I Even Watch The Video Because I Know It’s Going To Be Fire,YouTube
9556,"Solid review, will you be doing one on the Pixel 2 XL? I'm definitely going to but wanted to see what others thought too",YouTube
9557,Best review of the iPhone 8/8 Plus out there. At least from a camera perspective. Thank you for this.,YouTube
9558,You directly compete with Brandon Havard. Both of you have amazing shots.,YouTube
9559,"Fantastic content! I can’t wait to get my hands on the iPhone X and start playing with the new sensors, new processor, etc!",YouTube
9560,"I highly doubt Apple will ever adopt USB C on the iPhone. I think by the time lightening becomes obsolete ( in 2-4 years IMO), they'll just move to a totally portless design.",YouTube
9561,"It's shocking you only have 28k subs. I honestly expected you to have atleast 300k, you have earned a new sub my friend!",YouTube
9562,Nice video and review man. Subbed!,YouTube
9563,Is it so hard to title your video properly!? If u are reviewing the 8+ then title it 8+ ffs,YouTube
9564,"Unethical company.  Advertise an IP67 on their iPhone 8+ and won't even schedule a look at my water damaged phone.  It fell in the sink, what, half a foot of water?  Here is what it SHOULD cover:  Protected from immersion in water with a depth of up to 1 meter (or 3.3 feet) for up to 30 mins.  They have wiggle room for the water rating, citing barometric pressure and sea level.  Unbelievable, unethical and outright liars.",YouTube
9565,You're wife is smart and also has the better phone,YouTube

9594,Great review Tyler! Really like it...keep up the great work.,YouTube
9595,"Shoutout to that local Calgary content! ;) Only thing is, Nightshift is for reducing strain on eyes and, most importantly, being able to fall asleep faster as in nature blue light triggers you to wake up. So people should pump that up to whatever they feel is comfortable. True Tone is the feature meant for all day use.",YouTube
9596,"ayy calgary, represent",YouTube
9597,Your channel is so underrated man,YouTube
9598,"What a great review! In fact, probably the best I’ve seen! I have the 7 Plus and was debating whether to upgrade. I think I probably will now, based on this. Thank you!",YouTube
9599,Great review. Really comprehensive but a very fresh take.,YouTube
9600,Your Reviews are always so much more realistic and down to the ground! Have an 8plus and I'm amazed by the camera :),YouTube
9601,By far my favorite review so far!,YouTube

9608,"The review ive been looking for, other reviewers just point and shoot and the example photos are so ugly and i cant tell if the camera is good or not, but this is the type of review i needed ????",YouTube
9609,You deserve more views and more followers,YouTube
9610,"The Apple lightning cable does wear out and break within months. I would suggest using a braided 3rd party MFI certified lightning cable. I use one from this brand called “elove”. The first great thing about this cable is the charging speed. I don’t know how it does it but the speed is insane, it easily gets to 50% in 30mins with the same apple included power brick. The second great thing is auto charge stop, after the battery hits 100% the charging stops within next 10-15mins to avoid battery damage.",YouTube
9611,"whatttt when I heard the word Calgary , I thought I was tripping.  I live here LOL!!",YouTube

9616,"Though this is nice, phones will never come close with the quality of a DSLR. Good video though",YouTube
9617,omg your photographs is ??,YouTube
9618,adam from worth it????????,YouTube
9619,U deserve so many more subs Dam,YouTube
9620,"Dude, i love you. 1+ sub",YouTube
9621,No. Cases ruin the feel of the phone. One needs to feel the design of the phone to appreciate it fully.,YouTube

9632,They should make the apple logo on the back light up when on,YouTube
9633,Who else came here just because they're getting an iphone 8 ??,YouTube
9634,The future??? Yeah if this was 2013,YouTube
9635,7 ate 9,YouTube
9636,iPhone x is a rip off. Cost more with a  ugly display cut out and you loose a finger print scanner. But you can turn into a talking poop ? and chicken ?. So innovative and courageous..,YouTube
9637,Smh it's the same phone,YouTube
9638,Ok what are you doing in Singapore? :o omg I was shocked to see this was filmed in my country!,YouTube
9639,so because the new chips uses less energy to save more money in there pocket they put in smaller batteries and sell the phones for more money.... why not keep the same capacity battery as in the previous phones to make them run longer then?? apple  really knows how to use the isheeps out there.,YouTube
9640,i want a new iphone SE with the iphone 7 internals :D,YouTube
9641,Its a solid phone but a boring one. Just being honest.,YouTube
9642,I only update every 2 years. This builds my hype and makes me love the phone longer than 10 minutes,YouTube
9643,Yay! ?,YouTube
9644,"I've had no issue with lag in my iPhone 8 plus I have had issues with certain Android phones lagging. This seems to be a solid review so far . I have found for my 8 plus to take better low light photos then my note 8 ! Apple has really added what was need to make this a solid upgrade from the 7 Plus . As we all know the 7 Plus had a good camera, but lag behind some of its Android competitors . Not anymore this iPhone can go toe to toe with the Note 8 and beat it . DXO mark rank it at a 94 pretty much speaks for itself.",YouTube
9645,I like your videos but this one sucks you not telling the truth about ish lol. The iOS 11 is messing up crashing for the 1st time Apple has lag in the there software. IOS 10 is running better and faster then the iOS 11 and Apple is working on fixing the issues with the iOS 11. When are you ppl going to stop candy coating shit and just get down to the truth on what's really going on with iPhone 8 and 8 plus.,YouTube
9646,Save some money and get iphone 7 or 7 plus,YouTube
9647,The price just screws it up,YouTube
9648,"""Because the front of the phone is probably the object that you see the most each day, you want it to look great... not just good.""   This is exactly why I can't justify buying the upcoming iPhone X with that terrible notch at the top of the screen. I would rather keep the boring look and bigger bezels that don't obstruct some of the screen and create a sore for the eye. My only concern at this point is do I hold onto my iPhone 6 for yet another year and hope the next iPhone removes that awful notch, which I don't expect will happen for another FEW years due to Apple's stubbornness, or do I cave and get the 8 Plus.   I'm an Apple fan, but they have been dropping the ball significantly as of late, which is a shame, because they should be doing anything but for the milestone anniversary. The Note 8 is beautiful, and I would switch over to that in a heartbeat based on design alone, but I don't like the software. Decisions, decisions.",YouTube
9649,"One of the best iphone 8 review that i watched , i cant wait to get my iphone 8 plus gold soon ! ??",YouTube
9650,It's a freaking phone! Wtf has happened to our priorities. Came to check if it still can be used to make a call.,YouTube
9651,"At 2:13 when you said Iphone 8 needed a case, I swear I thought you were gonna plug stupid Dbrand and I was like 'OH HELL NO NOT FUCKING AGAIN'",YouTube
9652,Switching to S8 it is. These two phones are like a slap in the face for Apple fans who currently own 6s/6s plus. And the iPhone X costs an arm and a leg or even a kidney.  A great marketing strategy or a big push toward Androids?,YouTube
9653,My iPhone SE is better than these and I will keep it for a long time.,YouTube

9667,Plz do a review of 10.orG & the camera review i want,YouTube
9668,I got the 8 plus. The 10 is a literal rip off different display and facial recognition isn’t worth the thousand dollar price tag. Plus the X literally has the same internals as the 8 and 8 plus. Why spend 200 more for that?,YouTube

9676,To be very frank i found One ?5 (An iPhone copy in Android)  far far better then original iPhone 8 & 8+ in all aspects specially in charging & ?battery's back up technology with no excitement for iPhone 8 & 8+  Only excitement i got is for iPhone-X with better & beautiful design with bezel less screen,YouTube

9715,"I've had a galaxy s7 since it came out, I'm now switching to iPhone 8 plus.I used to think that Samsung had better features for a smartphone but there are so many issues with texting, and animation,it's just not smooth and simple like an iPhone. The iPhone 8 plus has a great battery unlike my Samsung that I have to charge ten times a day while barely using it on power saving it's just rediculous.I woke up with my Samsung fully charged . I didn't use it much except sending around 5 texts and I left the house at 80%.The camera quality on the Samsung front facing camera is disgusting and everytime I take a picture I look blurry. I'm so glad I'm switching to iPhone",YouTube

9731,"Your channel is named after iPhones but man, you sure do give them burns and aren't afraid to say it LOL",YouTube
9732,"In my opinion Apple had to release an affordable phone to the iPhone X.  It costs them nothing to repackage the iPhone 7 with minor upgrades and offer it as iPhone 8 vice 7s.  Who would want a 7s?  It is so far away from an iPhone 10 and sounds like yesterday's technology... hence naming it iPhone 8.    The iPhone X (10) is Apple's way of playing catch up with the rest of the cell phone scene.  The price is higher than a Samsung Note 8 and you get less technology and features, but honestly if you have been in the iPhone stream for years than it is a massive improvement and every IOS user should consider such an upgrade.",YouTube

9742,"iphone 8 supports fast charging but to use fast chraging you have to buy a extra fast charging power adapter,, fucking apple in every 200 Dollar Samsung is fast charging enabled",YouTube
9743,"I have the 8 plus space grey. Upgraded from a 5s so its much better though I agree its behind the times. Still prefer IOS however. One thing is that its heavier at the camera end now. It no longer balances on the DJI OSMO, it has a droop! Great job as always. :)",YouTube

9745,he sounds exactly like gru from despicable me lol,YouTube
9746,2:43 you can't escape! iPhonedo beyci?im :),YouTube
9747,Specs is not everything... actually I rather have lower monitor screen and longer battery life and stability efficient iPhone.,YouTube
9748,apple used to be 5 years ahead of competition   sad to see apple falling behind,YouTube
9749,"The iPhone X won't be much of a leap beyond what the 8 is either for those expecting it to be. It's pretty much the same with the exception of the new screen, FFC notch and OIS on both lenses. Of course, the 8 is better than the 7 but that's always the case. They wouldn't make a worse phone but Apple has been doing incremental updates for years now. Everything is slightly better than what we had before but they're really behind the competition, even with the X. The fact that it still records in mono is a joke when the likes of the V30 has a quad-dac and multi-mic set up and a camera app that allows you to do what you like rather than Apple's simple approach. The HTC 11 even uses its microphones to isolate sound when you zoom in (although I'd rather this be something you could use without zooming in as to not lose image quality).",YouTube
9750,"I was totally hoping you would start this video saying ""look what I got here, iphone 7s and 7s plus"" (intro) lol",YouTube
9751,"To answer your question, I believe Apple really lost it. They lost it a couple of years ago, but what they’ve shown us in the past 12 months with an outrageously limited MacBook Pro (completely useless touch bar gimmick, no I/O but USB-C), an Apple Watch that doesn’t even bother with a bit of design updates, and now the latest iPhones finally gives us Apple Fanboys the final proof, that the Apple we loved is gone.  In my opinion, iPhone 8 was merely put out there, so the outcry of the general media for a huge price jump of their flagship device wouldn’t be that loud. Now they can call the X super premium and of course you need to pay extra for a super premium... The problem with this is, that the X isn’t super premium either. It is just the next iteration of iPhone and should have been called 8 - full stop. I mean after years of basically hilariously minor tweaks, the X basically just gets back on eye-level with the competition. Sorry, but FaceID as replacement for a perfectly fine working TouchID is not a game changer. The bezel on the X still looks massive, compared to what you see at Samsung. Ok, now the display got taller - but as a result, we have to deal with an ugly and not very useful cut-out at the top. And then they have the impertinence to start that super premium flagship phone with a 64GB configuration!?! I mean, are you serious???  Problem is, there are enough idiots (like me), who will go for the X, just because it’s the next flagship phone and they/we can, and don’t care too much about a couple hundred bucks extra. Again, you see the pricing genius of Cook - sadly we don’t see the technology genius we loved at the times of Jobs. They know us idiots will pay the extra money for the fast charger, wireless pad or whatever shitty dongle they come up with. Sadly, and I mean really sadly, Apple seems to put so much more effort in finding out how much they can screw their customers (or in other words what their willingness to pay is and how they can further optimize profits despite not innovating anymore), than into developing truly amazing new gadgets, that show the rest of the world how it’s done.",YouTube

9767,dad jokes for daysssssssssss,YouTube
9768,"I honestly haven't found much clarity difference between my iPhone screen and the S8 screen. I feel that they keep the lower resolution is simply because that takes lesser battery power. Either way, I feel that a better solution would be to just make the phone a bit thicker, causing the elimination of the camera bump and addition of battery capacity. I think that would be a win win situation for everyone. I definitely like the thinness and form factor of the phone but would like it even more if it had a longer lasting battery. And then they could increase the resolution as well while keeping the battery life higher. Leaving this apart, I do feel that the 8 is a worthy upgrade from maybe a 6/6s, but definitely not from a 7.",YouTube
9769,"oh boy, don't you sound like Gru.. lol.. very charming",YouTube
9770,This guy reminds me of Gru from despicable me,YouTube

9776,"They called it 8 because if they call it 7S than X would be named 8 which compared to Galaxy S8 doesnt sound so futuristic, also X is the anniverysary phone (10). But if they call it 7S and X as is than they skip 8-9 so everyone would blame them for dont know how to count... but they still skipped 9 so what gives... i think im going off rails with this theory :DDD",YouTube
9777,They should have called it: iPhone 6sss,YouTube

Screwed out of $300+. But we can fix it for a Grand.... NOT!!!",YouTube
9805,"What Steve Jobs did with the first iphone was, indeed, create a new trend in the smartphone era. It was revolutionary what he did.   All the other phone companies copied him because they have smelled bankrupcy. Nokia didn't believe it and they went bankrupt.   Apple had the idea, the inovation and this gave everybody loads of posibilities to evolve and create more.   Unfortunately nowadays we see Apple being as stuborn as Nokia once was because they have invented it. They are not creating trends anymore and they are way behind with the technology.   They are copying ideas from the other vendors like samsung and they have no technology to put their money where their mouth is.  The first iphone was a perfect combination between software and hardware but as time passed, Apple just remained still and did not develop more at that operatind system, leaving it ... bold.   Paradoxally, this is what kept them floating all these years: the customers which had no intention of evolving and wanted everything simple but in a different case.   If you put an Android phone in the hand of an iphone user ... you kill him. He will not even know how to browse the internet, it is just amazing.   That being said, it is obvious why Apple still sells phones: because no mater how identical the phone is with the previous one, how totally unevolved and so .... from 2014 is, the previous iphone users will buy it because they CAN'T USE anything else. They don't have the mental strenght to adapt. Also, they are lazy as hell.  Also, the iphone users don't know ANYTHING about technology and figures, they just look at a picture and say THEIR opinion. They don't care about the resolution,  noise, focus, anything. ""YEAH, the picture looks good, great"". They may not tell the difference between the same picture taken with older iphone generation. So ... the technical capabilities of the device don't matter.  A very important aspect is the price of the device and also the pricing of all the other activities which you engage when owning an iphone. Everything is expensive and this feeds the snobism of every iphone user. The love to flash that phone because it is expensive and they want people to believe that they have money. One would think that if they've bought that phone, they should also have a nice house, great car and money for that coffee, right?  It is amazing, I have to admit it, how a product so unevolved cand sell so well. Just amazing!",YouTube

9808,Apple is blood sucker.,YouTube
9809,OOOOOMG FIRST ONE THAT MADE BY A TURKISH.,YouTube
9810,Um Samsung ships their phones with stock 1080p resolution. To get the higher 1440p you have to change the resolution in settings and go into a high performance mode which drains the battery significantly. Anything higher than 1080p is just a stupid gimmick anyway.,YouTube

9824,"Please do a similar comparison video between iPhone 8 plus and X.  (If you already have made such video, please point me to it - thnx)",YouTube
9825,You don’t have to buy the 70.00 fast charging kit. Just a regular fast charging wall outlet will charge it fast. Don’t get into there got to buy game. I bought the braided cable also with no issues.,YouTube
9826,iPhone 8 very bad. I took the Samsung galaxy s8 instead of iPhone 8. Very very bad iPhone apps and camera and high costly. Price is high no good.,YouTube

9842,"what needs people need on iphone 8 , iphone 6 completely also has.",YouTube
9843,"I have an 8+ and friends that have the 7+ and we've compared..the wireless charging is nice, the speakers sound better on the 8+, the camera and video are better, the processor is faster when you are editing video, better battery, better display, better all around..it is an upgrade, these things may not be important to you, but they are when YOU actually own the phone.",YouTube
9844,"While not an apple fan, I am always interested in what they make.  I've only ever had Android phones (since the HTC Desire days, then the Nexus 4).  The fact that last year's iPhone 7 runs the same software as the new iPhone 8 (or is that 7s or 6ss) is probably the best thing about iPhones.  With most mid-range Android phones you'll be using the OS that it ships with and that is that - Android's biggest failing is the very poor stance on upgrading the OS.  I buy unlocked but it makes no difference, OnePlus, Huawei, and Moto have all failed to upgrade the phone OS.",YouTube
9845,I don’t give a damn I just need a working phone ?,YouTube
9846,"3:39 I always thought the 7 plus battery was pretty good, always lasted me a good chunk of the day with heavy use. But then again I'm the type of person to take my charger with me everywhere so it wouldn't phase me either way but that's good to hear that the regular small 8 has good battery now, every other one before it (ESPECIALLY the 6s) had the worst battery of all time so I was forced to always get the bigger version, well only the 7 plus since I only ever owned two iPhone iterations.",YouTube

9855,"Let's just get straight to the point, this phone is a waste of money.?",YouTube
9856,to sum it up if you have a 7 i don’t recommend updating unless you really want a better battery. if you’re like me and has 5/5s/5c or 6/6s yes definitely,YouTube
9857,Honestly I don't know what you are doing with you're battery. If you would optimize a few settings you're battery would last up to 24 hours easily.,YouTube
9858,"No aux, no phone",YouTube
9859,There must be a conspiracy pushing wireless charging. I had it on my note 8 and it blows so hard. It has to be lined up perfect. You can’t use it while charging and it’s so damn slow. This is not a step forward! I invented the piano key neck tie!! I feel like I’m taking crazy pills!!,YouTube
9860,"Thanks Apple for going too the same design for 4 years, yes I have an iPhone 7 plus beautiful iPhone, but I went to a Galaxy note 8.",YouTube

9897,"I brought the 6 i am happy with it , the 6SS and the 6SSS can wait",YouTube
9898,"The only differences that truly matter are wireless charging and fast charging compatibility, both of which require additional money on additional accessories.",YouTube
9899,PLEASE stop comparing the same phone from last year ....Just skip this phone and tell iPhone fans to get the iPhone X.,YouTube
9900,iPhone 6SSS,YouTube
9901,I hope they bring back the matte finish for the black model.,YouTube
9902,"I still am very content with my 7 Plus, it’s not worth the upgrade.",YouTube
9903,I’m considering the X. That camera notch is ugly though.,YouTube
9904,Apple and it’s incremental improvements on its latest iPhone release.,YouTube
9905,Imagine the glossy black iPhone 7... literally looks like an 8.,YouTube
9906,Everybody saying they have the 8 and 7 I still have the 6s,YouTube
9907,iPhone 6 - 7 is an actual upgrade  iPhone 6s - 7 isn’t really iPhone 6s - 8 is an actual upgrade  iPhone 7 - 8 isn’t really  iPhone X is the real upgrade,YouTube
9908,How many videos do you need to make for you to realize that it’s not fucking worthy?,YouTube
9909,Hexacore and fast charging is worth it but it should be called iphone 7s,YouTube
9910,narrehootowl,YouTube
9911,So what is Better??,YouTube
9912,1st,YouTube
9913,I’m 12 and have a iPhone 8,YouTube
9914,We all know 8 is scared of 7 because 7 ate 9 which is why there is no iPhone 9,YouTube
9915,"I hate how ignorant people are. Who cares if the phone looks similar on the exterior...? The inside is completely different, and it'll be a worthy upgrade for me, coming from a 2015 16gb iPhone 6s.",YouTube
9916,iPhone 8? LMAO.,YouTube
9917,is the true tone thing another word for blue light filter?,YouTube
9918,God will buy me the iPhone 8 black,YouTube
9919,I've got the 7 but this is Total BS from Apple...,YouTube
9920,"Call me wrong but (personally) I’d rather my iPhone 7 over the iPhone 8 and iPhone X...I’m not spending extra money just for some wireless charging thing... it’s not a big deal, wireless or plug in charging. To be honest, it’s just about the same thing, and it takes around the same time. Plus, if you get the iPhone 8 and/or X, the back is just going to get scratched, cracked and for lots of people just covered by a phone case... So, you can’t even tell. Unless you have the iPhone X. I don’t want to get one, I’m not paying over 1000 dollars just for a screen extension. Once again, the it’s not like the screen in the normal iPhones is so small you can’t see it...so I simply cannot see the reason in getting a new phone when mine is only like 1 year old...not that even. The iPhone 7 colours are so much better too... don’t hate please this is just my opinion ??",YouTube
9921,"The only worthy upgrade to the iPhone 8 is if you're at least 3 generations behind or switching from android.   The only real attraction of the iPhone 8 is the camera and A11 Bionic. Other than that, iPhone 7 will suit all your needs.   For me, i'm getting the iPhone 8 because i'm on Android and I want the latest and best Apple product with a home button. I wont buy a phone if it has no home button. So.",YouTube
9922,"Between the two, The better one is      Galaxy S8",YouTube
9923,"Tbh it's the iphone 7s, really",YouTube
9924,"Haha iPhone 8 1821 mAh, iPhone 7 1960 mAh. OMG Apple is a joke. I can't believe how people still buy it.",YouTube
9925,Watching this on my iPhone 8 gloss back,YouTube
9926,"The only difference is...     ""Now it's 800 Dollars!""",YouTube
9927,"""get it....top notch""  A real knee slapper Marques.....   :)",YouTube
9928,Top Notch ??,YouTube
9929,One word that will make you smile...  *'Mr. Bean'*,YouTube
9930,I buy my phones so they are noticed from a distance. Because I have a lot of restraining orders.,YouTube
9931,"""Worth the Skip? "" Where is the answer ?",YouTube
9932,Whose watching this on an iPhone 10????,YouTube
9933,Where the fuck is iPhone 9 then?,YouTube
9934,Why do they call the iPhone X a 10?,YouTube
9935,This video is a click bait-ish. You didn’t answer your question “is it worth the skip”. You left it to the next video.,YouTube
9936,MKB8K ?,YouTube
9937,8 ftw. The advantage of X is the AMOLED screen,YouTube
9938,I'm personally not a huge fan of the asymmetrical display of the iPhone X. I Wish it looked like the S8.,YouTube
9939,Topnotch display and outstanding camera ?,YouTube
9940,"Went from the 7 to the X because of the design, I surely do miss Touch ID already but I guess Face ID is here to stay and I have to get used to it..",YouTube
9941,Whatever happened to the HTC One?,YouTube
9942,Oh the clickbait in this one...,YouTube
9943,"Can no one here see that Apple has copied the display from the Galaxy Note 8 , seriously I phone X looks like a Note 8 with a notch on the front anyway i understand Apple has become more of a Fashion brand than a performance phone it seems to me Apple has become a Trend Follower instead of a Trend Setter but thats been true for the last 3 years now , anyway if you have the cash to buy the phone and you want it then buy it but im just pointing out that Apple needs to really improve with the I phone 11 otherwise they will just be a Samsung clone.",YouTube
9944,How does Apple Pay work with the X? Does it use facial recognition to authorize Apple Pay?,YouTube
9945,"If the 10 freezes, it will be hard to reset it",YouTube
9946,Great video Marques,YouTube
9947,Ok few things people: 1.Telling someone to skip 8 because X is coming is like telling someone to cancel their Audi A1 because the new RS6 is right around the corner. PRICE PEOPLE PRICE !! ?? 2. Camera placement is deliberately different because they want you to have to re-buy your covers and skins.,YouTube
9948,"$150 less? That's for the 8 Plus, iPhone 8 4.7 is $699",YouTube
9949,"It’s a stainless steel band around the iPhone X, you accidentally called it aluminium. Nice video otherwise ?",YouTube
9950,"“They said 10, not X”         -Thank You",YouTube
9951,"Finally ,MKBHD on Streets",YouTube
9952,My conser for Face ID is that I have allergies and if my face swells up then I can’t get on to call my parents,YouTube
9953,*I'm going to get the Google Pixel 2 XL.*,YouTube
9954,"fuck the X, no touch id... Sure face ID is cool but I want OPTIONS not having to just use whatever they feel I should use. I'll probably pick up the 8 Plus since it may be the last iPhone I ever get if apple continues on the path of getting rid of things that are useful and make the phone easier to use.",YouTube
9955,"skip and get a note 8, they pretty much just copied the galaxy s8",YouTube
9956,"Which one is a better name? ""IPhone X"" or ""iPhone 10""???",YouTube
9957,"Yo, go watch the latest Samsung ad.",YouTube
9958,I can't afford the I phone 10 I work at burger king..,YouTube
9959,SKIP THE Iphone 10   I did !    here's why!   Its the Iphone 8 with a bigger OLED screen                its $1250 after tax for 256GB! the Notch will be GONE with the Iphone 10s or what ever and maybe hopefully cheaper after costs go down to make the 10,YouTube
9960,Since when skip worths ?,YouTube
9961,Why we need to swipe up when it isnt have any notifications? I hope in the future the face ID will jump right to home screen when it haven't any notifications!,YouTube
9962,"the iPhone X compact design is amazing but the brightness and ""whites"" on the LCD are still superior than the OLED. Even the perceived resolution is not that different between the plus and the X (it's different display technologies so using the ""on-paper"" resolution is not an apples to apples comparison. I wasn't that impressed by the quality of the OLED display tbh",YouTube
9963,Touch ID ????,YouTube
9964,"""Top Notch Display"" *Seinfeld theme starts*",YouTube
9965,no point in buying the iphone 8. it’s either you get the SE (cheapest) or the X (best right now). i know the 8 is a good phone but everytime you see a X you’ll ask yourself why you didn’t get that phone instead.,YouTube
9966,"Cool emoji machine, did Snapchat made the X?",YouTube
9967,Thats a Samsung product.,YouTube
9968,iPhone X is dope ?????,YouTube
9969,Keep thinking of getting iPhone X but price putting me off. I’ve had 6s from a few week after it came out. By far longest I’ve had the same phone.i used to get new phone every year but now there is nothing new phones can do. Live Photo’s was last new thing worth getting a phone for. Honestly think I’ll save the money and keep 6s til it either breaks or a new iPhone that does something new is brought out. Either way won’t be without a phone and won’t be wasting money.,YouTube
9970,Top Notch Display...Indeed !! ??????,YouTube
9971,Anyone else hyped for the Smartphone Awards? The phones this year have been so stacked,YouTube
9972,Never seen mkbhd wearing a watch?,YouTube

9980,"Hey MKHD quick question, does face ID work in the dark or even low light?",YouTube
9981,This guy is so handsome ?,YouTube
9982,"I was looking forward to the new iphone this year but looks like I will be getting the note8 instead, iphone x is a good phone but not a fan of the design without the home button, all other iphones are basically same",YouTube
9983,Omg!!! A black man with 5 million YouTube subscribers!!!! I love it!!! Get it brother!,YouTube
9984,I want to keep iPhone 6 for 2 more years.,YouTube
9985,U didn't answer the questions tf,YouTube

9987,"hey markques, i am looking for a phone but it doesn't seem to exist, can you help? 5"" or less Wireless charging NFC Waterproofing OIS Type C The closest thing i can find is the iPhone 8 4.7, and there is no android like that at all :(",YouTube
9988,WTH? He didn’t answer his own question.,YouTube
9989,"They could have just done a power button fingerprint reader or especially on the back, maybe even the apple logo on it at the same spot. No options? Thanks apple. Well does not affect me as i will probably stay on the android side for years as iphones 7--> are really overpriced and 6s or older have shitty batteries, well, there is no iphone with a good battery",YouTube
9990,360p,YouTube
9991,he didn't answer the question,YouTube
9992,Is it just me or is it every time a new phone comes out mines becomes slower,YouTube
9993,"My iPhone 7 Plus and 6s are obsolete , I must upgrade- gets iPhone X  Next month- Apple is unveiling the iPhone 12-8k recording",YouTube
9994,You just went over the features about what makes the phones different from each other. You didn't even bother answering the question in the title. This is some blatant clickbait.,YouTube
9995,Nice vid,YouTube
9996,this youtuber face is more darker then the black road when this youtuber walks only his tooth is seen all the body is invisible in night,YouTube
9997,I wish iPhone X wouldn’t use PWM...,YouTube
9998,I think I’m going to get the iPhone 8 Plus. I’m not feeling the X like I was the iPhone 6 when it came out. (Which is the phone I have right now),YouTube
9999,the pixel 2 tho,YouTube
10000,"I'm sorry, but it is BEYOND inconvenient to have to look at my phone full on every damn time I need to use my phone! There are going to be so many annoying times where it won't work right away, and you have to put it down and lift up again till it works.......just like it did in the actual presentation! LOL!! Also having to use motions instead of just hitting a quick button is going to piss a lot of people off. I can already tell that I will be on Facebook and want to switch to another app real fast, and I will have to try and swipe up at the VERY bottom of the screen just to go home, and hope it only takes me one try, instead swiping the page I'm on up. Of course I can't just switch between my apps without having to swipe up and again, and then try to keep my finger at just the right point on the screen so that I can see my other Apps I have up.",YouTube

10007,This comment shall save 7 minutes of your life The answer of is it worth it is “it depends”,YouTube
10008,"price wise I would compare the iPhone X to the iPhone 8 Plus because the iPhone X is basically an upgraded 8 Plus, because of their similar screen sizes,  not as comparable to the 8 other than physical device size.",YouTube
10009,*X Plus and I’m down*,YouTube
