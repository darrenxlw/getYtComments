I get maybe it could disappear like it does it movies and videos but it‚Äôs really not that in the way. That‚Äôs ridiculous.\\n\\nI‚Äôve had zero issues with how you‚Äôre describing True Tone.\\n\\n Also your issue with the telephoto OIS is because of how they use the telephoto lens. In low light they digitally zoom the wide angle lens in because it has a lower aperture(more light enters the lens). The telephoto is only really used in good lighting. Therefore the fact it‚Äôs not used as much means they don‚Äôt keep the lens constantly stabilized until it‚Äôs being used and determined by the camera it‚Äôs in a well enough lit situation to be used\\n\\nWith the exposure controls you must have something like auto HDR on. If you have ANY auto feature on it will over ride your manual control of the image.\\n\\nAll of the glitches I‚Äôve experienced have been due to third party apps not being upgrade for the phone. Haven‚Äôt had any on the OS itself from average usage. \\n\\nAlso my battery has been quite insanely good. I‚Äôm at 55% with over 4 hours use and nearly 10 on standby. You easily will get better batter than on any plus. The early battery life issues are from average drain setting up the phone. Installing apps and playing with the device more than you would on average. That happens whenever anybody gets a new phone usually. Even with that it took nearly a full day installing apps downloading movies and tv and getting settings right to get me under 40% even.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to notice auto brightness at all. It works how it does on any device. Most of the time it‚Äôll  never brighten automatically above even 85% or so. Colors don‚Äôt change any ever either.\\n\\nBattery percent is useless. If you really need a percent just go to the control center. I‚Äôll keep having the WiFi cellular signal and time any day over the battery percent of my phone.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt really see any of these as issues really. \\n\\nMy issues have been with devs being slow to update apps when they‚Äôve had a month to at least. Most devs says it only even takes a few days at most to update for full X support. Not that difficult.</td>\n",

       "5     On the X, You can view the battery percentage when swiping down to reveal Command Center. No need to swipe down all the way.  iOS 11 has been very disappointing. My 7 Plus was very stable with the first few versions of iOS 10, with great battery life. iOS 11 got me terrible battery life and many stability issues. After updating to 11.1 the battery life was fixed, but it‚Äôs still a VERY buggy OS. YouTube app won‚Äôt open GBoard keyboard. It‚Äôs ridiculous considering both apps are by Google.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "15    I'd rather have my Samsung Galaxy S8+. A MUCH better phone, with all the features Apple touts on the iPhone X, yet it only cost me $19.80 per month! Not $1000!!! What a RIP OFF!!! And, side by side comparisons of the 2 phones shows the S8+ beats the X hands down in nearly every way.

       "28    You have 8 5.8 display and you‚Äôre worried about a ¬æ inch long maybe 5mm wide line blocking text at the bottom of the screen?. Really? I get maybe it could disappear like it does it movies and videos but it‚Äôs really not that in the way. That‚Äôs ridiculous.\\n\\nI‚Äôve had zero issues with how you‚Äôre describing True Tone.\\n\\n Also your issue with the telephoto OIS is because of how they use the telephoto lens. In low light they digitally zoom the wide angle lens in because it has a lower aperture(more light enters the lens). The telephoto is only really used in good lighting. Therefore the fact it‚Äôs not used as much means they don‚Äôt keep the lens constantly stabilized until it‚Äôs being used and determined by the camera it‚Äôs in a well enough lit situation to be used\\n\\nWith the exposure controls you must have something like auto HDR on. If you have ANY auto feature on it will over ride your manual control of the image.\\n\\nAll of the glitches I‚Äôve experienced have been due to third party apps not being upgrade for the phone. Haven‚Äôt had any on the OS itself from average usage. \\n\\nAlso my battery has been quite insanely good. I‚Äôm at 55% with over 4 hours use and nearly 10 on standby. You easily will get better batter than on any plus. The early battery life issues are from average drain setting up the phone. Installing apps and playing with the device more than you would on average. That happens whenever anybody gets a new phone usually. Even with that it took nearly a full day installing apps downloading movies and tv and getting settings right to get me under 40% even.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to notice auto brightness at all. It works how it does on any device. Most of the time it‚Äôll  never brighten automatically above even 85% or so. Colors don‚Äôt change any ever either.\\n\\nBattery percent is useless. If you really need a percent just go to the control center. I‚Äôll keep having the WiFi cellular signal and time any day over the battery percent of my phone.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt really see any of these as issues really. \\n\\nMy issues have been with devs being slow to update apps when they‚Äôve had a month to at least. Most devs says it only even takes a few days at most to update for full X support. Not that difficult.   \n",

I get maybe it could disappear like it does it movies and videos but it‚Äôs really not that in the way. That‚Äôs ridiculous.\\n\\nI‚Äôve had zero issues with how you‚Äôre describing True Tone.\\n\\n Also your issue with the telephoto OIS is because of how they use the telephoto lens. In low light they digitally zoom the wide angle lens in because it has a lower aperture(more light enters the lens). The telephoto is only really used in good lighting. Therefore the fact it‚Äôs not used as much means they don‚Äôt keep the lens constantly stabilized until it‚Äôs being used and determined by the camera it‚Äôs in a well enough lit situation to be used\\n\\nWith the exposure controls you must have something like auto HDR on. If you have ANY auto feature on it will over ride your manual control of the image.\\n\\nAll of the glitches I‚Äôve experienced have been due to third party apps not being upgrade for the phone. Haven‚Äôt had any on the OS itself from average usage. \\n\\nAlso my battery has been quite insanely good. I‚Äôm at 55% with over 4 hours use and nearly 10 on standby. You easily will get better batter than on any plus. The early battery life issues are from average drain setting up the phone. Installing apps and playing with the device more than you would on average. That happens whenever anybody gets a new phone usually. Even with that it took nearly a full day installing apps downloading movies and tv and getting settings right to get me under 40% even.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to notice auto brightness at all. It works how it does on any device. Most of the time it‚Äôll  never brighten automatically above even 85% or so. Colors don‚Äôt change any ever either.\\n\\nBattery percent is useless. If you really need a percent just go to the control center. I‚Äôll keep having the WiFi cellular signal and time any day over the battery percent of my phone.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt really see any of these as issues really. \\n\\nMy issues have been with devs being slow to update apps when they‚Äôve had a month to at least. Most devs says it only even takes a few days at most to update for full X support. Not that difficult.</td>\n",

       "5      On the X, You can view the battery percentage when swiping down to reveal Command Center. No need to swipe down all the way.  iOS 11 has been very disappointing. My 7 Plus was very stable with the first few versions of iOS 10, with great battery life. iOS 11 got me terrible battery life and many stability issues. After updating to 11.1 the battery life was fixed, but it‚Äôs still a VERY buggy OS. YouTube app won‚Äôt open GBoard keyboard. It‚Äôs ridiculous considering both apps are by Google.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "15     I'd rather have my Samsung Galaxy S8+. A MUCH better phone, with all the features Apple touts on the iPhone X, yet it only cost me $19.80 per month! Not $1000!!! What a RIP OFF!!! And, side by side comparisons of the 2 phones shows the S8+ beats the X hands down in nearly every way.

       "28     You have 8 5.8 display and you‚Äôre worried about a ¬æ inch long maybe 5mm wide line blocking text at the bottom of the screen?. Really? I get maybe it could disappear like it does it movies and videos but it‚Äôs really not that in the way. That‚Äôs ridiculous.\\n\\nI‚Äôve had zero issues with how you‚Äôre describing True Tone.\\n\\n Also your issue with the telephoto OIS is because of how they use the telephoto lens. In low light they digitally zoom the wide angle lens in because it has a lower aperture(more light enters the lens). The telephoto is only really used in good lighting. Therefore the fact it‚Äôs not used as much means they don‚Äôt keep the lens constantly stabilized until it‚Äôs being used and determined by the camera it‚Äôs in a well enough lit situation to be used\\n\\nWith the exposure controls you must have something like auto HDR on. If you have ANY auto feature on it will over ride your manual control of the image.\\n\\nAll of the glitches I‚Äôve experienced have been due to third party apps not being upgrade for the phone. Haven‚Äôt had any on the OS itself from average usage. \\n\\nAlso my battery has been quite insanely good. I‚Äôm at 55% with over 4 hours use and nearly 10 on standby. You easily will get better batter than on any plus. The early battery life issues are from average drain setting up the phone. Installing apps and playing with the device more than you would on average. That happens whenever anybody gets a new phone usually. Even with that it took nearly a full day installing apps downloading movies and tv and getting settings right to get me under 40% even.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to notice auto brightness at all. It works how it does on any device. Most of the time it‚Äôll  never brighten automatically above even 85% or so. Colors don‚Äôt change any ever either.\\n\\nBattery percent is useless. If you really need a percent just go to the control center. I‚Äôll keep having the WiFi cellular signal and time any day over the battery percent of my phone.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt really see any of these as issues really. \\n\\nMy issues have been with devs being slow to update apps when they‚Äôve had a month to at least. Most devs says it only even takes a few days at most to update for full X support. Not that difficult.   \n",

       "10000  I'm sorry, but it is BEYOND inconvenient to have to look at my phone full on every damn time I need to use my phone!\\nThere are going to be so many annoying times where it won't work right away, and you have to put it down and lift up again till it works.......just like it did in the actual presentation! LOL!!\\nAlso having to use motions instead of just hitting a quick button is going to piss a lot of people off.\\nI can already tell that I will be on Facebook and want to switch to another app real fast, and I will have to try and swipe up at the VERY bottom of the screen just to go home, and hope it only takes me one try, instead swiping the page I'm on up.\\nOf course I can't just switch between my apps without having to swipe up and again, and then try to keep my finger at just the right point on the screen so that I can see my other Apps I have up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
